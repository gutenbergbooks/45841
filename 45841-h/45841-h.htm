  <h1 class='c006'>THE OCEAN WIRELESS BOYS ON WAR SWEPT SEAS</h1>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c007'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br />THE GOLD SHIP.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The newspapers announced in large type that
the <em>Kronprinzessin Emilie</em>, the crack flyer of the
Bremen-American line, was to carry from the
United States to Germany the vast sum of
$6,000,000 in bullion. On her sailing day the
dock, from which she was to start on what destined
to prove the most eventful voyage ever
made since men first went down to the sea in
ships, was jammed with gaping crowds. They
interfered with the passengers, and employees of
the company had to jostle their way among them
as best they could.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
The thought of the vast fortune stowed within
the tall, steel sides of the liner had attracted
them, although what they expected to see of it
was difficult to imagine. But just as a crowd
will gather outside a prison where some notorious
malefactor is confined, feasting their eyes
on its gray walls without hope of seeing the lawbreaker
himself, so the throngs on the <em>Kronprinzessin
Emilie’s</em> pier indulged their curiosity
by staring at the colossal casket that held such
an enormous fortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among those who had to win their way
through the crowd almost by main force, were
two tanned, broad-shouldered youths carrying
suitcases and handbags.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My, what a mob, Jack!” exclaimed one of
them, elbowing himself between a stout man
who was gazing fixedly at the vessel’s side—and
showed no disposition to move—and an equally
corpulent woman whose mouth was wide open
and whose eyes bulged as if she almost expected
to see the ship gold-plated instead of black.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
“Yes, gold’s a great magnet even if it is stowed
away inside the specie room of a steamer,” replied
Jack Ready. “We ought to feel like millionaires
ourselves, Bill, sailing on such a ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A sort of vacation <em>de luxe</em>,” laughed Bill
Raynor. “What a chance for the buccaneers of
the old days if they could only come to life again.
Then there would be real adventure in sailing
on the <em>Kronprinzessin</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess we’ve had about all the adventure we
want for a time, Bill,” replied Jack, as they finally
gained the gang-plank and two white-coated,
gilt-buttoned stewards grabbed their
hand baggage. “The Pacific and New Guinea
provided what you might call ‘an ample sufficiency’
for me in that line.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We earned this holiday, that’s one thing
sure,” agreed Bill, “and the best part of it is
that the sale of those pearls gave us enough funds
for a holiday abroad without putting too much
of a crimp in our bank accounts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He referred to the pearls the boys’ native
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
chums in the Pamatou Islands in the South Pacific
had presented them with, after their narrow
escape from death in the sea-cave and the
subsequent wreck on a coral reef, during the
memorable Pacific voyage and adventures,
which were described in detail in the volume of
this series which immediately preceded the
present book. This volume was called, “The
Ocean Wireless Boys on the Pacific.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first book of this series, which was
called “The Ocean Wireless Boys on the Atlantic,”
we were introduced to Jack Ready, then
the young wireless operator of the big tank
steamer <em>Ajax</em>. His chum, Bill Raynor, was a
junior engineer of that craft. A strong friendship
sprang up between the two lads, which their
subsequent adventures on that voyage cemented
into a lasting affection.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack also won the approval of Jacob Jukes,
head of the great shipping combine that owned
the <em>Ajax</em> and a vast fleet of craft, both passenger
and freight, besides, by his masterly handling of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
a difficult situation when the millionaire shipping-man’s
yacht burned in mid-Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c009'>This incident, and others which proved that
the young wireless man was level-headed and
cool, even in the worst emergency, resulted in
his being transferred to the passenger service on
board the West Indian service craft, the <em>Tropic
Queen</em>. The thrilling events that accompanied
the vessel’s last voyage were set forth in the second
volume of the Ocean Wireless Boys series,
entitled, “The Ocean Wireless Boys and the
Lost Liner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Still another book related how Jack and his
chum took to the seas again on different vessels,
only to be reunited in the strangest manner.
“The Ocean Wireless Boys of the Iceberg Patrol,”
as this was named, told something of the
work of the craft detailed by Uncle Sam to the
duty of patrolling northern seas, sending wireless
warnings of icebergs to trans-Atlantic liners—a
work of infinite usefulness which, had it
been instituted earlier, might have averted the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
loss of the <em>Titanic</em>, the greatest marine disaster
in the history of the world. This was followed
by an account of the exciting Pacific adventures
already referred to.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys, and their employer, Mr. Jukes,
agreed with them, and felt that after their experiences
in the South Seas with the millionaire’s
expedition in search of his lost brother, they had
earned a holiday; and their determination to
tour Europe was the outcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>But even as they stepped on board the “Gold
Ship,” the machinery of war was beginning to
rumble in Europe, and before many hours had
passed, the storm of well-nigh universal war
was destined to begin. Of this, of course, they
had no inkling, as they busied themselves in establishing
their belongings in their main-deck
cabin. These preparations had hardly been
completed when the siren boomed warningly,
and a tremor ran through the big vessel. As she
backed out of her pier, the brass band began to
play and the crowds on the decks, and on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
docks, waved wildly, cheered and shouted last
messages which, by no possibility, could have
been heard above the din.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, off at last, Jack,” said Raynor, entwining
Jack’s elbow in his own as the two leaned,
side by side, on the railing, bidding good-bye to
New York’s wonderful skyscraper skyline as it
slid past. “How does it feel to be a passenger?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack’s eyes sought the lofty wireless aerials
swung far above them between the two masts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It feels mighty odd to think of somebody else
sending out the T. R.” he said slowly, naming
the wireless method of saying “Good-bye,” on
sailing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I never saw such a fellow!” exclaimed
Raynor. “For goodness’ sake forget your everlasting
coherers and keys and converters and the
rest of them and enjoy taking life easy. But—hullo!”
he broke off, “there’s someone we know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Approaching them was a dapper little man,
with a neat black moustache and dressed in a
careful, almost dignified manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
“Why, it’s Raymond de Garros, that French
aviator we saved from the sea off Florida when
we were on the old <em>Tropic Queen</em>!” exclaimed
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the man. But what in the world is he
doing here? I thought he was in France organizing
an aeroplane corps for the army.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So did I. The newspapers have had several
despatches about his work. But we shall soon
find out about the reason for his being on board.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A minute later they were warmly shaking
hands with the little Frenchman, who, with
many gesticulations and twirlings of his moustache,
assured them how glad he was to “greet
zee two brave boys zat save my life from zee
sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re the last person we expected to see,”
said Jack, when first greetings were over. “We
didn’t even know you were in America.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little Frenchman shrugged his shoulders
and looked about him uneasily. Then he buttonholed
the boys confidentially.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
“No one know zat I am here but my government,”
he said in low tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are on a secret mission of some kind?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I trust you to keep somethings to yourselves
if I tell you what I am do in Amerique?”
asked the aviator.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, but if you don’t wish—— I
didn’t mean to appear inquisitive,” Jack hastened
to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Zat is all right, my friend!” exclaimed de
Garros. “You save my life. I should be ungrateful
if I seemed secretive wiz you. I have
been in Amerique buying and shipping aeroplanes
to France from one of your manufacturers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I thought France already had a powerful
air fleet,” said Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little aviator’s next words were astonishing
to the boys, who shared the common
impression about the French strength in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Before many days are past we shall need all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
and more aeroplanes than we have,” he said.
“I wish we had twice as many. But I can say
no more now. But my advice to you is to watch
zee wireless closely. You are going abroad on
pleasure?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, we thought we’d earned a vacation,”
said Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little Frenchman’s rejoinder was a shrug
and a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your vacation may be what you Americans
call a ‘strenuous one,’” he said meaningly, and
with an emphasis the boys could not fathom.
“By the way, on board this ship I am Jules Campion.
There are reasons for my real name being
unknown for the present. <em>Au revoir</em>, I go to arrange
my luggage. We shall meet again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he was gone, leaving the boys to exchange
puzzled glances.</p>

  <h2 id='chII' class='c007'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />WAR IS DECLARED!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Vell, Yack Retty, you yust like to hang
aroundt undt see me vurk, hein?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hans Poffer, the yellow-haired, red-cheeked
wireless operator of the <em>Kronprinzessin Emilie</em>
asked the question, on the afternoon of the third
day out. Jack had discovered in young Poffer
an acquaintance he had made in Antwerp when
he was on board the <em>Ajax</em>, and had renewed the
friendship, to Poffer’s great delight, for the German
wireless man had had trouble with his instruments
the first day out which Jack had adjusted
for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since that time Jack, to Bill Raynor’s amusement,
had spent most of his time in the wireless
room enjoying, as Poffer put it, “watching me
work.” But there was another reason beside his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
deep-seated interest in everything appertaining
to his profession that made Jack haunt the <em>Kronprinzessin’s</em>
wireless coop. De Garros, with
whom he had had several conversations since
their meeting on board, had repeatedly told him
to be on the lookout for something “that would
before long come over the wires.” Once, in
discussing the boys’ plans for amusing themselves
in Europe, the aviator had said meaningly,
“if you ever get there.” But what he
meant by these words he had steadfastly refused
to explain, telling Jack that he would find out in
good time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me, if I gedt idt a holliday,” said Poffer,
after greeting Jack a day later, “I go by as far
avay from der vireless as I couldt gedt idt. I
gedt sick undt tired hearing idt all day ‘tick-tick’
undt sending idt all day der same ‘tick-tick’
alretty. Donner! I’m hungry again. Holdt idt
mein key a minute vile I gedt idt mineself a
bite.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The stout German slipped his wireless “ears”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
from his head and extended them to Jack, who,
good-naturedly, took them. Then he made off
for his cabin where he kept constantly a stock of
provisions to satisfy his appetite between meals.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’m a fine chump,” smiled Jack, as he
slipped into Hans’ vacant chair. “No wonder
Bill says I’m crazy. Off for a holiday and the
first thing I know I find myself back on the job.
Hullo, here’s a message coming. K. P. E., that’s
our call. Funny sort of sending, too. Doesn’t
sound like a commercial operator.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack crackled out a reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the <em>Kronprinzessin Emilie</em>,” he
flashed back; “what do you want?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell your captain to lie to in his present position
till further orders,” came the reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I like your nerve,” flashed back Jack,
thinking somebody was trying to play a wireless
joke on him. “Don’t you know we are carrying
the European mails from New York? You
stick around where you are and we may bump
into you on the way back again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
“Never mind about that. Obey orders at
once,” came back bruskly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, never mind that comedy,” implored
Jack. “I’m busy. Ring off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No trifling there, young man,” was flashed
back. “This is the British cruiser <em>Essex</em>. We
want to overhaul you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you can’t stop a mail steamer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In this case we can. War has been declared
by England upon Germany and Austria. Lay to
or it will be the worse for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A step sounded behind Jack. He turned
quickly, thinking it was someone who wanted
to send a message, in which case he was anxious
to “cut out” the man he thought was playing a
senseless joke on him. The newcomer was de
Garros.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, sitting at zee wire, eh? I suppose our
always hungry Teutonic friend iz taking ze light
lunch somewhere. Ah, any news? I saw you
working ze key as I came in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No news since I came on,” said Jack,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
carelessly. “I was just trying to convince some deep
sea joker that he couldn’t fool me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, somebody just flashed a message to the
ship that they were the British cruiser <em>Essex</em> and
that war had been declared between England
and Germany and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He got no further. De Garros’s hands flew
out and seized his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Zat was no joke, <em>mon ami</em>,” he exclaimed; “it
was zee truth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The truth? How do you know?” asked the
naturally astonished Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It has been in zee air for months in diplomatic
circles. I thought zee declaration would
have come before this. It was for that that I
was in Amerique buying aeroplanes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What, is France in this, too?” demanded the
astonished Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and Russia also. Russia declared war
two days ago. Then came France, zee second
member of zee Triple Entente, as zee is called,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
and now, as was expected, comes England to
help against the German barbarians.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how did you know all this?” demanded
Jack. “There was nothing in the papers when
we left New York, but something about a row
between Austria and Servia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which caused all the trouble,” came the
reply; “or, rather, zee match to zee powder.
But zee ask me how I know zee declaration of
war of Russia and France. I am not the only
man on zee ship zat does. Captain Rollok, he
knows, zee officers know, like me zey have been
getting wireless messages in code. Zey have
been warned to look out for English cruisers in
case England joined France and Russia. Zis
Gerrman ship with six million dollars in gold
on board would be a fine prize for Great Britain.
My friend, before many hours have passed,
you are going to have some excitement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great gracious, then that message wasn’t a
joke and that British cruiser may overhaul us
and take all that bullion?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
“If she can catch us,—yes. She will also
make prisoners of the Germans on board and
take the ship to an English port.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What had I better do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here comes young Poffer now. Tell him of
zee message and get it to zee captain at once.
If we are caught we may be delayed indefinitely
and zee haste is imperative with me at zee present
time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The German wireless man entered the cabin,
gnawing at a huge pretzel. At Jack’s information
of the message that had come, he dropped
it to the floor in his astonishment and stood staring
for a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Himmel!” he exclaimed, when he found his
voice. “Englandt is go var midt Yarmany!
Undt a Bridish sheep chase us. <em>Ach du lieber</em>,
if they catch us, Hans Poffer goes by a prison
yet midt nudding to eat but bread undt
vater——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind about that now,” interrupted
Jack quickly; “take that information to Captain
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
Rollok at once. Take it yourself. Don’t give it
to a steward. If the passengers knew of this,
there’d be a panic in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Poffer, still with his mouth and eyes wide
open, hurried off on his errand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Captain Rollok will probably come back
himself,” declared de Garros, “and vee will be
ordered out of the cabin. Ve had better go now.
But vee must not say a word of zees till zee time
comes. Vee have more as two thousand passengers
on board and if zey zink a warship chase
us,—<em>sacre!</em>”</p>

  <h2 id='chIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />ON DECK ONCE MORE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Jack was lolling in a deck chair fifteen minutes
later, still digesting the astonishing news
that had come out of space, when a deck steward
approached him and, with an air of caution,
leant over the lad and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Captain Rollok would like to see you in the
wireless room at once, please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now what’s up?” wondered Jack, as greatly
astonished by this message, he made his way to
the radio cabin. “I guess I’m in for a call down
for sitting in at the key. Poor Poffer, I’ll see that
he doesn’t get into trouble if I can help it, and as
for me—I’m a passenger now and captains have
no terrors for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These thoughts occupied him as far as his destination.
Within the cabin were Captain
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
Rollok, a giant of a man, with a fresh complexion
and huge blond beard, one of his officers and
Hans Pollak, the latter looking in fear of his
life as the big captain berated him, in German,
with force and vigor. As Jack entered the cabin,
the great bulk of the captain swung round on
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you are de young mans who sits in at der
vireless vile dis cabbage-head goes stuffing himself
midt pretzels, is it?” he demanded, with
what appeared great severity, but with an underlying
twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack contented himself with nodding and a
brief admission that he had taken Poffer’s place
at the key while the latter refreshed himself.
He half-expected an outburst from the big German
but, to his astonishment, the captain
clapped him on the back with a force that almost
knocked him off his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Ach, du lieber!</em>” he exclaimed; “it was goot
dot you vod dere, uddervise dis foolish Poffer
would haf left der key anyvay undt dot British
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
cruiser would have overhauled us. Now I got
a proposition to make to you. You are a vireless
man. Our second operator is sick undt idt is
necessary dot dere is someones at der vireless all
of der time. Vill you take der chob?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack hardly knew what to say. The proposal
had come so abruptly that he found it hard to
make up his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You would want me to help out all the way
to Europe?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are not going to Europe,” was the reply.
“I am going to run back for der American coast
undt try to dodge capture. Six million dollars
is a big enough prize to make der search for us
pretty active. I don’t believe dere would be a
chance for us to reach der udder side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Jack, after some consideration,
“I guess my holiday is off anyhow, and I might
as well get down to work now as later on. All
right, Captain, you can count on me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Goot for you. I vill see dot you are no loser
by idt,” said the big German, and so Jack, by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
strange combination of undreamt-of circumstances,
became the wireless man of the “gold
ship,” whose subsequent adventures were destined
to fill the world with wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poffer’s hours of duty ended at dinner time
that evening, and by the time Jack sat down at
the key, it was dark. No more word had come
from the British cruiser, and so far the <em>Kronprinzessin’s</em>
course had not been altered. A
hasty message in cipher had been sent to the offices
of the line in New York, but so far no orders
to turn back had come through the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, Jack had not been on duty an hour
before the expected command came. The passengers
strolling and sitting about the decks were
suddenly aware that the big ship was slowing
up and being turned about. The incredulous
ones among them were speedily convinced that
this was actually the case when it was pointed
out that the moon, which had been on the starboard
side of the ship in the early evening, was
now to be seen off the port quarter.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
Rumors ran rife throughout the great steel
vessel. There had been an accident to the machinery,
there were icebergs ahead, some plot
against the security of the gold in the specie
room had been discovered—these, and even
wilder reports, were circulated. The captain
and the other officers were besieged for explanations,
but none were forthcoming, for the time
being.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shortly before midnight, however, the captain
in person entered the smoking room with a
telegram in his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gentlemen,” he announced to those assembled
there, “I am sorry to say that var has been
declared bedween England and Germany, Great
Britain siding against my Vaterland mit France
and Russia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He held up his hand to quell the hub-bub that
instantly broke loose. When a measure of quiet
was restored, he resumed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Id is therefore imbossible for the voyage of
this ship to continue. As you haf observed, her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
course has been altered. Ve are on our way back
to America.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To New York?” demanded a score of voices.</p>

<p class='c009'>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“New York vill be vatched more carefully
than any udeer port on der Atlantic coast,” he
said. “I haf not yet decided for vere I vill
make; but I ask you all to take der situation philisophically
and try to quiet any alarm among
der lady passengers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The turmoil of questions and answers and excited
conversation broke out again, and in the
midst of it the captain’s broad form disappeared
through the doorway. A few moments later,
Raynor was in the wireless room after a fruitless
search for his chum in other parts of the
ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, what are you doing sitting at that key?”
he demanded. “Have you gone to work for the
ship?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looks that way, doesn’t it?” smiled Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you know that we are running away
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
from British cruisers?” asked Raynor, breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Knew it before the ship was turned around,”
said Jack, calmly. “But I couldn’t have told
even you about it at the time. It was confidential.
But there’s no reason why you shouldn’t
hear it all now,” and he launched into a narration
of the events just passed which had had such
a strange culmination. He was in the midst of
it, when one of the junior officers of the ship
appeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>He told the boys they would have to close the
door of the wireless room and cover the ports.
Not a ray of light must be visible about the
ship, he informed them. In the darkness even
the glow of a single port-light might give a
clue as to the whereabouts of their quarry to the
lurking British cruisers. In the passengers’
quarters of the great ship, similar orders were
issued. Stewards went about blanketing portholes
and turning out all unnecessary lights. By
ten o’clock, except in the “working” quarters of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
the ship,—and there, they were carefully concealed,
as in the wireless room,—there was not
a light on board.</p>

<p class='c009'>In order to insure obedience to his orders, the
captain had had the cabin lights disconnected
from the dynamos at that hour. On the darkened
decks, little groups of timid passengers,
who refused to go to bed, huddled and talked in
low tones, constantly gazing seaward to catch
sight of a tell-tale searchlight which would tell
of pursuit or interception.</p>

<p class='c009'>Through the darkness, the great ship was
driven at top speed without warning lights of
any description. Watches were doubled, and on
the bridge, the unsleeping captain kept vigil
with his anxious officers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Through the long hours, Jack sat unwinkingly
at his key. But it was not till the sky was
graying the next morning that anything disturbed
the silence of the air. Then came a break
in the monotony. The British cruiser <em>Essex</em> was
speaking to the <em>Suffolk</em>. But the messages were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
in code and told nothing except that Jack caught
the name of the liner and knew the radio talk
between the warships concerned her.</p>

<p class='c009'>At breakfast time the passengers assembled in
the saloon, for the most part anxious and haggard
after sleepless nights. The captain spoke
encouragingly, but even his words had little effect.
Every one on board felt and showed the
strain of this blind racing over the ocean with
watchful naval bull-dogs lying in wait ready to
pounce on the richest prize afloat on the seven
seas.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c007'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />ICEBERGS AHEAD!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>That night a dense fog fell. But the pace of
the fleeing liner was not slackened by a fraction
of a knot. Without running lights, and with
darkened decks and cabins, she raced blindly onward
through the smother, facing disaster if she
struck an obstacle. The passengers, already
nerve-racked for the most part, almost beyond
endurance, named a committee which was sent to
the captain to protest against the reckless risk
he was taking in ploughing ahead at top speed
through the blinding mist.</p>

<p class='c009'>They returned with a report that the captain
had refused to slacken speed. With reckless
fatalism, it appeared, he was prepared to lose
his ship in a disaster rather than run the chance
of its capture by cruisers of the country with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
which his ruler was at war. A new feeling, one
of indignation, began to spread through the big
ship. Little knots gathered and angrily censured
the captain’s action. Some even visited
him in person, but while he was polite to all,
he firmly refused to reduce speed or display
lights.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the condition of affairs when Jack
came on duty accompanied by Bill Raynor, who
had agreed to share his lonely vigil, for, from
being one of the most sought out places on the
ship, the wireless room was now deserted by
the passengers, for strict orders had been given
against the sending or receiving of any wireless
messages lest the watching cruisers should get
definite information of the liner’s whereabouts
and pounce upon her.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was little for Jack to do under this
“ukase” but to lean back restfully in his chair,
with the receivers over his ears on the lookout
for what might be coming through the air. He
and Raynor chatted, discussing the wild flight
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
of the “gold ship,” intermittently, as the hours
passed. But suddenly Jack became alert. Out
in the dark, fog-ridden night, two ships were
talking through the air. They were, as he
learned after a moment of listening, the <em>Caledonian</em>
of the English Anchor Line and the
<em>Mersey</em>, which also flew the British flag.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young wireless man listened for a time
and then “grounded” with a grave face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s up now?” asked Raynor, noticing
this. “If it’s the cruisers, I don’t mind, for only
the Germans and Austrians would be held as
prisoners. I’d kind of like to be ‘captured,’ as a
novelty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This trouble’s worse than cruisers,” rejoined
Jack, in sober tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Icebergs,” said Jack, sententiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Icebergs at this time of the year?” asked Bill,
incredulously, for bergs are rare in August on
the usual steamer lanes, though occasionally
seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
“That’s what,” rejoined Jack; “the <em>Caledonian</em>
was telling the <em>Mersey</em>. She says they are
sown thick to the northwest of us. You’ve got to
remember that we’re a long way to the north of
the usual steamer tracks now, so it’s not surprising
that the ‘growlers’ are about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but it’s mighty unpleasant,” said Raynor.
“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell the captain about it at once,” said Jack,
decisively, rising and putting on his cap.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope he puts on the brakes when he hears
about it,” commented Bill. “I’m not particularly
nervous, but going full speed ahead
through the fog into a field of bergs doesn’t just
exactly feel good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m only glad that the passengers don’t
know about it,” said Jack. “They’re scary
enough now. If they knew about the bergs, I
firmly believe some of them would have to be
put in strait jackets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, about the only cool ones on board are
the Americans and the English,” declared Bill.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
“I heard to-day that a party of American millionaires
got together in the smoking room and
laid plans to make an offer to buy the ship and
run her across anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That sounds like the American spirit all
right,” chuckled Jack. “What became of the
idea?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The captain told them the ship was not for
sale,” said Bill, “even if they offered to throw in
the millions in the specie room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack found Captain Rollok and his officers in
anxious consultation in the former’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha, so you haf the news, is it?” demanded
the captain, as Jack entered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and not very good news, I’m sorry to
say,” said Jack. “The <em>Caledonian</em> has just been
telling the <em>Mersey</em> that there are icebergs
ahead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The officers exchanged glances. They all
looked at the captain. Evidently some orders
were expected, with the greatest peril the sea

One of them,—Second Officer Muller, who
had the watch,—put his anxiety into words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it that you will change the course or reduce
speed, Captain?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>The big, bearded captain turned on him like
a flash. He raised his massive fist and brought it
down on the table with a crash that bade fair to
split the wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We keep on as we are going!” he exclaimed.
“Rather than let this ship get into the hands of
the English, I’ll send her to the bottom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the passengers!” exclaimed Jack;
“surely——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Herr Ready,” said the captain, “I am in command
of this ship. The orders are full speed
ahead.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Bill Raynor received Jack’s news with a shrug.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not surprised, to tell you the truth,” he
said. “I’ve met a good many Germans in the
course of my sea-going years, and that’s usually
their idea,—rather sink the ship than give it
up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the fearful danger, Bill,” protested Jack.
“At any moment there may come a crash
and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got iceberg detectors,” said Bill, “and
maybe they’ll sound the whistle and locate a big
berg by the echo.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They won’t sound any whistle to-night,” declared
Jack. “That skipper is determined not
to give any cruiser the least inkling of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
whereabouts. I’m going to take a run on the deck, the
wireless bell will call me if something comes.
Want to join me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. But it’s not much of a night for a
stroll outside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anything’s better than sitting in that cabin
waiting for you-don’t-know-what to happen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re getting nervous, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so much for my own sake as at the
thought of all these thousands of tons of steel
being raced through this fog at a twenty-four
knot clip and icebergs ahead. It’s sheer madness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, the captain’s word is law at sea, so it’s
no use protesting. We must hope for the best.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The upper decks were deserted except for the
boys. On the lower deck the passengers huddled
in the darkness behind canvas screens erected
to prevent any chance ray of light from filtering
out. It was an uncanny feeling this, of speeding
through an impenetrable pall of blackness with
the thought of the iceberg warning ever and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
anon recurring to both lads, though they tried to
talk of indifferent subjects.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hours wore on and the fog did not lighten.
Chilled to the bone, although it was August,
Jack and Bill had about decided to turn in when
there came a sudden sharp cry from the lookout
forward. Involuntarily, Bill clutched Jack’s
arm. The strain had affected them both more
than they cared to admit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly, dead ahead of them, as it seemed,
there reared, seen white through the mist, a monstrous
spectral form. It towered above the
steamer’s masts and appeared to their alarmed
imaginations to hang like an impending cliff
above the ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the bridge came quick shouts. Orders
were given and harshly echoed. Somewhere
down on the passenger decks, a woman screamed.
Then came cries of consternation. The next moment
there was a slight shock and a long, shuddering
grind passed along the vessel’s side. The
mountainous ice mass appeared to sheer off, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
in reality the ship was swinging clear of it. By
a miracle she had escaped with a mere graze of
her side. At diminished speed, she continued on
her course.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phew, what a narrow escape!” exclaimed
Jack, as the fog shut in about the monster berg
they had sheered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought we were goners, sure,” declared
Bill, soberly. “A little of that sort of thing goes
a long way. I—— Hark!”</p>

<p class='c009'>From the lower decks there now came the confused
noise of a frightened crowd. Now and
then, above, could be heard the shrieks of an
hysterical woman. Sharp, authoritative voices
belonging, as the boys guessed, to the officers,
who were trying to quiet the panic-stricken
throngs, occasionally sounded above the babel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re coming this way!” cried Jack suddenly,
as a rush of feet could be heard making
for the ascents to the boat deck, where the wireless
coop was situated. “Bill, we’ll be in the
middle of a first-class panic in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
“Yes, if that crowd gets up here among the
boats, there’s going to be the dickens popping,”
agreed Bill. “What will we do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run into the wireless room. In the drawer
of the desk by the safe there are two revolvers.
One’s mine and the other belongs to Poffer.
Get them on the jump.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It did not take Bill long to carry out his errand,
but in even the short time that he had been
absent, the forefront of the terrified crowd from
below was almost at the head of the companionway
leading from the promenade to the boat
deck. Jack had stationed himself at the head of
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep cool, everybody,” he was shouting;
“there is no danger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The <em>Titanic</em>!” shrieked somebody. “We’ve
hit an iceberg. We’ll sink like her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The boats!” shouted a man. “We’ll lower
’em ourselves. We’re sinking!”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the gloom Jack could see the man’s face,
round and white, with a big yellow mustache.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic003'>
<a href='images/i2f.jpg'><img src='images/i2.jpg' alt='' class='ig003' /></a>
<p>“Keep cool, everybody,” he was shouting; “there is no danger.”—<i>Page</i> <a href='#Page_42'>42</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
The fellow shoved two women, wedged in the
throng, aside, and addressed himself to Jack,
who stood at the head of the companionway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me pass, you!” he bellowed, seemingly
mad with fear. “I want a place in the first boat.
I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack felt Bill slip a revolver into his pocket.
But he did not remove the weapon, the time had
not yet come for its use.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop that noise,” he told the yellow-mustached
man bluntly. “Ladies and gentlemen,”
he went on, “there’s no danger. We merely
grazed the berg. Thank heaven the ship was
swung in time to save her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t believe him,” shrieked the terrified
man. “Stand to one side there. The boats!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He made a rush for Jack and struck heavily
at the young wireless operator. But before his
blow landed, Jack had crouched and the next
instant his fist shot out like a piston rod. The
fellow staggered back, but could not fall because
of the pressure of humanity behind him.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
It is difficult to say what might have happened
had there not been cooler heads in the
crowd. Reassured by Jack’s cool manner, these
began quieting the more timid ones. Just then,
too, Captain Rollok and some of his officers appeared.
All carried drawn revolvers, for a disorganized
rush on the boats would have meant
that scores of women would have been trampled
and many lives lost in the confusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The captain’s firm, stern tones completed the
work Jack and Bill had begun. He assured the
passengers that an examination had been made
and that no damage had been done. He also
promised thereafter to run at a more moderate
speed. Gradually, the excited crowd calmed
down, and some sought their cabins. The
greater part, however, elected to remain on deck
throughout the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning the fog had somewhat
cleared and the break-neck speed of the ship was
resumed. Jack was just resigning the key to
young Poffer when the doorway was darkened
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
by a bulky figure. It was that of a big, yellow-mustached
man, whom Jack recognized instantly
as the man who had led the panic of the night
before, and whom he had been forced to deal
with summarily.</p>

<p class='c009'>He furiously glared at Jack, and the boy noticed
that under his left eye was a dark bruise,
a memento of the previous night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did you mean by striking me last
night?” he began angrily. “I demand your
name. I will have you discharged.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My name is Ready,” answered Jack calmly,
“and as far as having me discharged is concerned,
I’m afraid that will be impossible. You
see I’m here in what you might call an extra-official
capacity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bah! don’t be impudent with me, boy. I am
Herr Professor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, a barber,” smiled Jack, amiably.</p>

<p class='c009'>The yellow-mustached man fairly growled.
His light blue eyes snapped viciously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am Herr——”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
“Oh, yes, I see you’re here,” responded Jack
calmly. “You seem to be in rather a bad temper,
too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boy, I will see that you are punished for
this. I am a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, it would be as hard to tell it on you
this morning as it was last night,” responded
Jack, in quite unruffled tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be very careful, young man. I have already
told you I am Herr Professor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t hang out the barber pole again,”
begged Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other shot a glance full of venom at the
perfectly cool youth before him. Then, apparently
realizing that there was nothing to be
gained from indulging in tirades, he turned abruptly
on his heel and strode to the door. On
the threshold he paused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going to report your conduct to the
captain at once,” he said. “You will find out
before long what such gross impertinence to a
passenger means.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
“I shouldn’t advise you to tell him about your
behavior last night, though,” observed Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because from what I’ve observed of him, he
is a rather hot-tempered man and he might feel
inclined to throw you out of his cabin—and it’s
quite a drop from there to the promenade
deck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will hear more of this,” snarled the infuriated
man; but at Jack’s parting shot he made
off, looking very uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poffer regarded Jack with a look in which admiration
and awe were oddly blended.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dink you haf for yourself made idt
troubles,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Trouble! In what way?” demanded Jack.
“The fellow is an arrant coward. He——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah yah, dot is so, but den he is Herr——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gracious, have you got hair on your brain,
too?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yah,” was the innocent response. “He is a big
Professor at a Cherman War College. He is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
great man in Germany, der Herr Professor Radwig.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Mr. Earwig, or whatever his name is,
may be a great man as you say, Hans, my boy,
but he is also a great coward. As for his threat
to make trouble with the captain, that does not
bother me in the least. To begin with, I’m only
a volunteer, as it were, and in the second place,
I’ll bet you a cookie or one of those big red
apples you’re so fond of, that Mr. Earwig will
avoid discussing the events of last night as much
as he can. I’ve heard the last of him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But in this Jack was wrong. In days that lay
ahead of the boys, they were to find that Herr
Professor Radwig was ordained to play no unimportant
part in their lives.</p>

  <h2 id='chVI' class='c007'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />SMOKE ON THE HORIZON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Late that afternoon Jack, who had just come
on deck, was in time to notice an unusual thrill
of excitement among the already overwrought
passengers. On the northern horizon was a
smudge of smoke, and a dark hull bearing down
on them. Those who had glasses had already
announced the other craft to be a warship, although,
of what nation, it was as yet impossible
to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack hurried to the wireless room. Young
Poffer declared that he had received no wireless,
nor intercepted any message which might
have any bearing on the identity of the strange
ship. On the bridge, the ship’s officers were in
excited consultation. The warship was drawing
closer every moment. She was black and squat,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
with two fat funnels from which volumes of dark
smoke rolled. At her bow was a smother of
white foam showing the speed at which she was
being pushed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ach, now comes it!” exclaimed Poffer the
next instant. He wrote rapidly and then handed
the message to Jack. The wireless boy read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Heave to at once.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dutton, commanding His Majesty’s ship <em>Berwick</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll take it forward right away!” exclaimed
Jack. “You listen with all your ears for any
more messages, Hans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You bet you my life I will undt den some,”
Hans promised. “Vot you dink, dey shood us
up, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. I suppose if we don’t heave
to, they will,” said the wireless boy as he hurried
off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chust as I thought,” declared Captain Rollok,
after he had read the message.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
“Shall I tell Hans to send back word we’ll
stop?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop! I vouldn’t stop for der whole British
navy,” declared Captain Rollok vehemently.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stepped to the engine room telegraph and
set it violently over to “Full speed ahead.”
Then he picked up the engine-room telephone
and gave orders to pile on every ounce of steam
possible. The great ship quivered and then
sprang forward like a grayhound from a leash.
Clouds of black smoke rose from her funnels,
deluging the decks with ashes as force draught
was applied to the furnaces.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack hastened back to the wireless room. He
found Poffer, pop-eyed and frightened looking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s another cruiser coming up on the
other side!” he exclaimed. “I just heard her
talking to the <em>Berwick</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s nice,” commented Jack, as Bill Raynor
and de Garros appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo, Bill,” he continued. “You’ll have a
chance to be under fire now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
“What do you mean?” demanded young Raynor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely it is that the captain will stop?” asked
the French aviator.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop nothing,” rejoined Jack. “He doesn’t
appear to care what he risks, so long as he saves
his ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought I felt her speeding up,” said Bill.
“So he’s going to cut and run for it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the size of it,” responded Jack, while
the Frenchman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are not understandable, these Germans,”
he commented.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here comes it anudder message,” struck in
Hans, holding up his hand to enjoin silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>They all looked over his shoulder as he wrote
rapidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your last warning. Heave to or take the
consequences.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was signed as before by the commander of
the <em>Berwick</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
“My friends, this captain had better heed that
warning,” said de Garros. “Englishmen are not
in zee habit of what zee call ‘bluffing.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>But when Jack came back from the bridge,
whither he had sped at once with the message,
it was to report the captain as obdurate as ever.
His only comment had been to call for more
speed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess he thinks we can show that cruiser a
clean pair of heels,” said Raynor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That looks to be the size of it,” agreed Jack,
“but he is taking desperate chances. Let’s go
outside and see the fun.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The cruiser was coming toward them on an
oblique line now. From her stern flowed the red
cross of St. George on a white field, the naval
flag of England. They watched her narrowly
for some minutes and then Jack exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jove! I believe that with luck we can outrun
her. The <em>Kronprinzessin</em> is the fastest ship of
this line, and if her boilers don’t blow up we may
be able to beat that cruiser out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
“I hope so,” declared Raynor, fervently. “I’m
not exactly a coward but I must say the idea of
being made a target without having the chance
to hit back is not exactly pleasant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As I shall be in zee thick fighting not before
very long, I might as well receive my baptism
of fire now as any other time,” said the Frenchman.
“I expect to be placed in charge of zee
aviation corps, and I am told zee Germans have
some very good aeroplane guns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look,” cried Bill, suddenly, “they are going
to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>A white mushroom of smoke broke from the
forward turret of the cruiser, followed by a
screeching above their heads. Then came an
ear-splitting report.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great guns! Where is this going to end?”
gasped Bill, involuntarily crouching.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c007'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br />A SHOT AT THE RUDDER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Ach Himmel!</em>” groaned Hans Poffer. “Suppose
dey hit us vee——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He got no further. There was another burst
of smoke, a quick, lightning-like flash and the
same screech of a projectile. But this time, accompanying
the sound of the report, was a sound
of tearing metal and the ship shook as if she had
struck on the rocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The after funnel,” cried Jack, pointing to a
jagged hole in the smoke stack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The next one may come closer,” choked out
Bill rather shakily.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the lower decks there was the wildest confusion.
Women were fainting and the stewards
and petty officers had all they could do to handle
the frightened throngs. The striking of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
funnel was the occasion for an angry and badly
scared deputation to wait upon the captain and
demand that he stop the ship at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the deputation did not reach the bridge.
They were met at the foot of the stairway leading
to it by a polite but firm officer who informed
them that under no circumstances would
the captain tolerate any interference with his
method of running the ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>A third shot, which went wide, closely followed
the one that had struck the after funnel.
It flew high above them and caused Jack
to observe:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe they mean to hit the hull,
but only to scare the captain into heaving the
boat to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looks that way,” agreed Bill, “and as for
the scare part of it, I guess they’ve succeeded,
so far as everybody is concerned but Captain
Rollok and his officers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are gaining on zee cruiser without a
doubt,” asserted de Garros, whose eyes had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
fixed on the pursuing sea fighter for some minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but look, there comes another,” cried
Jack, suddenly, pointing astern. “That must be
the one Poffer heard signaling to the <em>Berwick</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re in for it now,” said Bill. “I wish that
pig-headed captain would heave to and let them
take the gold and the Germans, if that’s all they
are after.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo!” exclaimed Jack, suddenly, as they
all stood waiting nervously to see the next flash
and puff from the cruiser’s turret. “I can see a
gleam of hope for us. See what’s ahead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ahead of them the sea appeared to be giving
off clouds of steam as if it was boiling. As yet
this vapor had not risen high, but it was rapidly
making a curtain above the sunny waters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fog!” cried Bill, delightedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It cannot be too thick for me,” said de Garros.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps Captain Rollok foresaw this and
that was why he refused to halt,” said Jack.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
“Certainly, if we can gain that mist bank before
we get badly injured, we’ll be all right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now a race for the thickening fog curtains.
The cruisers appeared to realize that if
the <em>Kronprinzessin</em> could gain the shelter of the
mist, there would be but small chance of their
capturing her. Increased smoke tumbling from
their funnels showed that they were under
forced draught. But as their speed increased so
did that of the “gold ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gun boomed again on the <em>Berwick</em>, the
foremost of the pursuers. The projectile struck
the stern of the liner and knocked the elaborate
gilt work wreathing, her name and port, into
smithereens.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aiming at the rudder,” commented Jack.
“That’s a good idea from their point of view.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But a mighty bad one from ours if they succeed
in hitting it,” said Raynor, with a rather
sickly laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two more shots, one of them from the second
cruiser, flew above the fugitive liner and then
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
the mist began to settle round her swiftly-driven
hull in soft, cottony wreaths. In five minutes
more the fog had shut in all about her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then ensued a game of marine blind-man’s
buff. Captain Rollok, having steamed at full
speed some miles through the fog,—and this time
there were no protests from passengers,—altered
his course and deliberately steamed in circles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hark!” exclaimed Jack, during one of these
manœuvers. “What was that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Out in the fog somewhere they could hear a
sound like the soft beating of a huge heart. It
was the throbbing of another vessel’s engines.
To the fear of the chase now was added the peril
of collision, for in the fog, dense as it was, the
captain would not permit the siren to be
sounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was almost impossible to tell from which direction
the sound was proceeding. It seemed to
be everywhere. Was it another peaceful vessel
like themselves, or a man-of-war? Much depended
on the answer to this question.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
All at once, with startling distinctness, a huge
black bulk loomed up alongside them. Through
the fog they caught a sudden glimpse of
crowded decks and great guns projecting from
grim-looking turrets. It was one of the British
cruisers. By grim irony, the fog had delivered
them into the hands of their pursuers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Scott, it’s all off now!” cried Bill, as
they simultaneously sensed the identity of the
other craft.</p>

  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br />LAND HO!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But the strange cruise of the <em>Kronprinzessin
Emilie</em> was not destined to come to an end then,
although, for an instant, it appeared so.
Whether the Britisher was mutually astonished,
and in the confusion the right orders were not
given, or whatever the cause was, before they
had more than glimpsed her grim, dogged outlines,
she faded away in the fog and was blotted
out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phew! A few more close shaves like that
and I’d be looking in the mirror to see if my
hair hasn’t turned gray,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder they didn’t take some action,” commented
Bill, “although I’m glad they didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps zey was so astonished zey forgot to
fire zee gun,” suggested de Garros.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
“I guess that was it,” agreed Jack, “but just
the same it was a mighty lucky thing for us they
didn’t come to their senses sooner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, this thing of playing tag in the fog gets
on my nerves,” muttered Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>By nightfall, they had steamed through the
fog belt, but every eye was anxiously turned
astern as if their owners expected at any moment
to see the ram-shaped bows of the black British
sea bulldogs come poking put of the mist.</p>

<p class='c009'>But nothing of the sort happened, however,
though late that night, far to the eastward of
their course, they could see the glowing fingers
of the cruisers’ searchlights pointing in every direction
across the sea. The next day passed
without any untoward happenings, and when,
the morning following, Jack gazed from the
wireless coop he saw, in the first faint light of
dawn, that they were steaming along a strange,
unfamiliar, rugged coast.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time the passengers were astir, the outlines
of the coast had become dotted with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
cottages and houses, and in the midst of breakfast
they steamed into a harbor, and the anchor was
dropped with a roar and a rumble. Like a flash,
the tables in the saloon were deserted. There was
a general rush for the deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, that house over there looks just like
my home at Bar Harbor,” cried one woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ten minutes later her words were confirmed.
It <em>was</em> Bar Harbor, Maine, into which the
sorely-harried liner had taken refuge under the
neutral protection of the Stars and Stripes. Not
daring to run into New York or Boston, the captain
had selected the world-famous summer resort
as a harbor that the English cruisers would
be the least likely to watch, and his judgment
proved sound. And so ended the cruise of the
“gold ship,” in whose strange adventures the
boys were ever proud of having participated.
An hour after the great liner’s arrival, she was
almost deserted by her passengers who were
choking the telegraph wires with messages.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wireless disseminated far and wide the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
news of her safe arrival, and they learned,
ashore, that for days the fate of the “gold ship”
had been the puzzle of the country. All sorts
of wild guesses had been printed as to her whereabouts.
She had been reported off the coast of
Scotland and again in the English Channel. One
rumor had it that she had been captured, another
that she had been sunk and most of those on
board lost.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not one of these guesses, however wild or
probable, came within striking distance of the
extraordinary truth of the “gold ship’s” flight
across the war-swept seas. The day after their
arrival, and while the town was still seething
with excitement over the great liner’s presence
in the harbor, Jack received a telegram at the
hotel where he, Raynor and de Garros had taken
up temporary quarters. The message was from
Mr. Jukes and read as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Learned by the papers of your safe return.
Kindly call at my office as soon as possible after
your arrival in New York. Important.”</p>

<p class='c010'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
“What’s in the wind now?” exclaimed Jack to
Bill Raynor, who was with him when he got the
message.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said Raynor;
“but I have a sort of notion in the back of my
head that your vacation is over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you can call it a vacation,” laughed Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well then, perhaps experience would be a
better word,” substituted Bill, also laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>That evening, arrangements having been
made about the shipment of their baggage to
New York, the boys and the young French aviator
obtained their tickets from an agent of the
steamship company, for the line was bearing all
expenses, and took a night train for home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost as soon as they reached the city, Jack
visited Mr. Jukes’ office.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank goodness you’ve come, Ready!” he exclaimed
as soon as he had shaken hands with the
lad, upon whom, since their adventures in the
South Seas, he strangely came to rely; “the
<em>St. Mark</em> sails to-morrow for Europe. I don’t
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
know yet, in the middle of this European muddle,
just what ports she will touch at. That must
be settled by her captain later on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Mullen is on the <em>St. Mark</em>,” began Jack.
“I wouldn’t wish to usurp his job and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And anyhow, it’s your vacation,” interpolated
the magnate. “I know all that, Ready, and
depend upon it, you won’t suffer by it if you
agree to my wishes. It isn’t exactly as wireless
operator I want you to sail on the <em>St. Mark</em>, it’s
on a personal mission in part. My son, Tom,
is among the refugees somewhere in France. I
don’t know where. I haven’t heard a word since
this war started, but the last I know he was auto
touring north of Paris. He may even have gone
into Belgium, for that was a part of his
plan.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you want me to try to find him?” demanded
Jack slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know it’s a big job, but I know that
if anyone can carry it through, you can. Expense
is no object, spend all you like but find the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
boy. This suspense is simply killing his mother
and worrying me sick.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m willing and glad to take the job, Mr.
Jukes,” said the young wireless man, “but, as
you say, it’s a big undertaking and has about one
chance in a hundred of being successful. Besides,
you may have heard of him and his whereabouts
even before the <em>St. Mark</em> reaches
Europe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll take my chances of that,” declared the
millionaire. “It’s action that I want. The feeling
that something has actually been done to find
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On these conditions, I’ll go and do my best,”
said Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Ready, thank you. I knew you
wouldn’t fail me. Now about funds. They tell
me finances are all topsy-turvy over there now.
Nobody can get any American paper money or
travelers’ checks cashed. That may be Tom’s
fix. You’d better take gold. Here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He drew a check book out of a drawer and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
wrote out a check of a size that made Jack gasp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get gold for that,” he said, as he handed it
over, “and when that’s gone, Linwood and Harding,
of London, are my agents. Draw on them
for what you need. And, by the way, is there
anybody you want to take with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was going to say, sir,” said Jack, “that for
a task like this, Bill Raynor——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The very fellow. I’ll never forget him in
New Guinea. A splendid lad. But will he go
with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I rather think he will,” rejoined Jack with a
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c007'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br />A STRANGE QUEST.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Readers of earlier volumes of this series will
recall Tom Jukes, who, after being cast away
when his father’s yacht burned at sea, was found
by Jack’s clever wireless work. This was the
youth,—he was about Jack’s own age,—whom
the wireless boy had been commissioned to find.
Although the task appeared, as Jack had said,
one almost impossible of accomplishment, still
Jack was boy enough to be delighted at the prospect
of traversing war-ridden Europe and possibly
playing a part in the mightiest struggle of
all time. As for Bill Raynor, he was wild with
excitement at the idea. Uncle Toby Ready,
when he was told of the intended trip, shook his
head and muttered something about “playing
with fire,” but he was eventually won over and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
presented Jack with a dozen bottles of the
Golden Embrocation and Universal Remedy for
Man and Beast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If so be as you meet up with the Kaiser, or
the King of England, or the Czar, just give ’em
a bottle with my compliments,” he said in bestowing
the gift. “By the flying jib, it might be
the means of building me up a big European
trade. Think of it, Cap’n Toby Ready, P. O. H.
R. H.—Physician in Ordinary to His Royal
Highness. If you don’t run acrost any of them
skippers of state you can just distribute it around
careless like, and draw special attention to the
directions and to my address in case the prescription
should require to be refilled.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack promised, but it is to be feared that the
Golden Embrocation never got nearer Europe
than the cabin of the square rigger <em>Jane Harding</em>,
of Halifax, Nova Scotia, which happened
to be in the Erie Basin unloading lumber. Captain
Podsnap, of the <em>Jane Harding</em>, was an ardent
admirer of, and believer in, Captain Toby’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
concoctions which, as the compounder boasted,
never were known to do harm even where they
didn’t do good. To Captain Podsnap, therefore,
Jack hied himself perfidiously and made over
to him the gifts intended for ailing royalty.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <em>St. Mark</em> was what is known as a “popular”
ship. That is, she usually crossed with full
cabins. But on the present trip there were a
bare score of passengers in the first cabin, not
many more in the second, while in the steerage
were a couple of hundred travelers, mostly reservists
of the various countries at war, returning
to Europe to take up arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they steamed down the harbor, the docks
on each side of the river could be observed to
be crowded with idle steamers of all sizes, from
small freighters to huge four-funnelled liners.
With smokeless stacks and empty decks, they lay
moored to their piers, offering an eloquent testimonial
to the almost complete paralysis of ocean
traffic that marked the earlier days of the war.
Off Tompkinsville, Staten Island, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
dreadnought, <em>Florida</em>, swung at anchor, grim in her
gray war paint,—Uncle Sam’s guardian of neutrality.
It was her duty to keep watch and ward
over the port to see that no contraband went out
of the harbor on the ships flying the flags of combatting
nations and in other ways to enforce
President Wilson’s policy of “hands off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With dipping ensign, the <em>St. Mark</em> slipped by,
after a brief scrutiny by a brisk young officer.
Then, down the bay she steamed, which the boys
had traversed only a few days before on the
hunted <em>Kronprinzessin</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Jack, old fellow,” observed Raynor,
as Jack leaned back after sending a few routine
messages of farewell and business of the ship,
“off again on our travels.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and this time, thank goodness, we’re
under Uncle Sam’s flag, and that means a whole
lot in these days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does, indeed,” agreed the other fervently,
“but have you any idea what port we are bound
for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
“Not as yet. We are to get instructions by
wireless, either from the New York or London
offices.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This a queer job we’ve embarked on, Jack,”
resumed Raynor, after a pause in which Jack
had “picked up” <em>Nantucket</em> and exchanged
greetings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is indeed. I only hope we can carry it
through successfully. At any rate, it will give
us an opportunity to see something of the war for
ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a great chance, but as to finding Tom
Jukes, I must say I agree with you that a needle
in a hay stack isn’t one, two, three with it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A heavily built man, dark bearded and mustached,
entered the wireless cabin. He had a
despatch ready written in his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Send this as soon as possible, please,” he said,
handing it to Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>As his eyes met those of the young wireless
man he gave a perceptible start which, however,
was unnoticed by either of the boys. Raynor
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
was paying no particular attention to the matter
in hand and Jack was knitting his brows over
the despatch. It was in code, to an address in
New York and was signed Martin Johnson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry, Mr. Johnson,” said Jack, “but we
can’t handle this message.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t? Why not?” demanded the passenger
indignantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because it is in code.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that got to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“While the war lasts we have instructions not
to handle code messages or any despatches that
are not expressed in English that is perfectly
plain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s preposterous,” sputtered the passenger
angrily. “This is a message on a business
matter I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you’ll write it out in English, I’ll transmit
it,” said Jack; “that’s what I’m here for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man suddenly leaped forward. He
thrust a hand in his pocket and pulled out a roll
of bills.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
“Can I speak to you confidentially?” he asked,
turning his eyes on Raynor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anything you’ve got to say you can say before
my friend,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, see here—there’s a hundred dollars
in that roll,” as he threw it on the desk, “forget
that code rule a while and it’s yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, Mr. Johnson,” said Jack coldly,
“I’ve already told you what my orders are. As
for your money, if it was a million it would be
just the same to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bah! You are a fool,” snapped the other,
angrily snatching up the money and flinging out
of the cabin, crumpling the code message in his
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That infernal boy again,” he muttered, as
he gained the deck outside. “This only makes
another score I have to settle with him. These
Americans, they are all fools. Well, Von Gottberg
in New York will have to go without information,
that’s all, if I can’t find some way
of getting at the wireless.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
“Say, Jack,” asked Raynor, as the bearded
man left the cabin, “did that fellow remind you
of anybody?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who, Johnson?” asked Jack idly. “Why
yes, now that you come to mention it, there was
something familiar about his voice and his eyes,
but for the life of me I couldn’t place him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor I, and yet I’ve a strong feeling that
we’ve met him somewhere before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Johnsons are as thick as blackberries,” commented
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but I don’t connect that name with this
man. It was some other name altogether. Oh,
well, what’s the use of trying to recall it—anyhow,
Mr. Johnson, whoever he is, hasn’t got
a very amiable temper. I thought he was going
to swell up and bust when you refused that message.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But further comment on the irate passenger
was cut short at that moment by a beating of
dots and dashes against Jack’s ears, to which one
of the “receivers” was adjusted. He hastily
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
slipped the other into place and then turned to
Raynor with a grin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s our old friend, the <em>Berwick</em>,” he said.
“She’s outside waiting for us, but this time, glory
be, we’re flying Old Glory.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c007'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br />UNDER OLD GLORY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Sandy Hook lay behind a dim blue line on the
horizon, and the long Atlantic heave was beginning
to swing the <em>St. Mark</em> in a manner disconcerting
to some of the passengers, before they
came in sight of the cruiser that had led the
<em>Kronprinzessin</em> such a harried chase.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looks familiar, doesn’t she?” commented
Jack, as they slowed down and the <em>Berwick</em>
steamed up alongside, about five hundred yards
off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it hadn’t been for that lucky fog, she’d
have looked more familiar yet,” declared Bill.
“Look, they’re lowering a boat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>From the cruiser’s side a small boat, crowded
with uniformed sailors, and in the stern sheets
of which sat a smart junior officer, dropped and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
propelled by long, even strokes of the oars which
rose and fell in perfect unison, was presently
coming toward the liner. The <em>St. Mark’s</em> accommodation
ladder was lowered, and in a few
minutes the young British officer was aboard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every passenger was lined up in the saloon and
compelled to answer questions as to their nationality,
etc. All passed satisfactorily. Then
came the turn of the second cabin and the steerage.
From the second cabin, two admitted German
reservists were taken as prisoners of war
and in the steerage six more were found. They
took their apprehensions stoically, although they
knew that they would probably be confined at
Halifax or Bermuda till the close of hostilities.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack and Bill Raynor watched these scenes
with interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose it will be months, maybe years, before
some of those poor fellows see their homes
again,” said Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but it’s what you might call the fortune
of war,” responded Jack briefly.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
So expeditiously was the work of culling out
the reservists done that an hour after the <em>Berwick’s</em>
officers had boarded the liner, the last of
the prisoners was off and the ship’s papers had
been inspected and O.K.’d. With mutual salutes,
the two craft parted, the <em>Berwick</em> to lie
“off and on,” looking for commerce carriers of
a hostile nation, the <em>St. Mark</em> to resume her voyage
to a Europe which was even then crowded
with desperate, stranded American tourists unable
to obtain money or passage home.</p>

<p class='c009'>At dinner time Muller, the <em>St. Mark’s</em> regular
operator, relieved Jack, and he was free for
the evening. He elected to spend his leisure
time reading up in a text-book, lately issued, an
account of the workings of a new coherer that
had recently been brought out.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the fatigues of the day had made him
drowsy and he soon dropped off to sleep in the
chair he had placed on the upper deck in the
shelter of a big ventilator. Despite the time of
year there was a cool, almost a chilly breeze
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
stirring, and most of the small number of first-class
passengers were either in the smoking room
or the saloon.</p>

<p class='c009'>How long he slept Jack did not know, but he
was awakened by the sound of voices proceeding
from the other side of the ventilator, which
masked him from the speakers’ view. One of
the voices, which Jack recognized as belonging
to Martin Johnson, grated harshly on his ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it hadn’t been for that cub of a wireless
boy,” Johnson was saying, “that message would
have been in the hands of Von Gottberg by this
time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so you haven’t been able to send word
about the British cruiser?” inquired the other
speaker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, and from the same cause. I shall have
to see what I can do with the night operator.
He may not be so absurdly scrupulous, unless
that young whelp who was on day duty has been
talking to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you say, Herr Professor, that you had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
met him before?” asked the last speaker’s companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, confound him, on the <em>Kronprinzessin
Emilie</em>. I was—er—I was trying to organize
an orderly retreat to the boats after the alarm
had been spread that British cruisers were after
us, when this young scoundrel attacked me brutally.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t you report him to the captain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you see there were—er—reasons which
made it unwise to do so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You bet there were, Herr Professor Radwig,—for
I know who you are now, Mr. Johnson,”
muttered Jack to himself. “No wonder
I thought I knew you in spite of your disguise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are your present plans?” asked Mr.
Johnson’s, or rather, Herr Professor Radwig’s
companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall have to see. You understand wireless,
Schultz?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Intimately. Why, you have some idea—?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind now. It is getting chilly. Let
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
us go to our cabins. I will talk to you more
about this to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The voices died away as the two left the upper
deck. Jack, wide awake now, sprang to his feet.
Clearly there was some mischief concerning the
wireless in the air. But of the nature of the impending
scheme he could not hazard a guess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anyhow, I’ll just put Muller wise to what’s
going on,” thought Jack. “He’s a decent, square
fellow, who wouldn’t stand for any monkey business.
How to deal with Herr Radwig is another
matter. I guess I’ll sleep on it. If only those
chaps on the <em>Berwick</em> knew who they had overlooked
on their hunt for Germans, wouldn’t
they be mad as hornets!”</p>

  <h2 id='chXI' class='c007'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br />THE “HERR PROFESSOR” AGAIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was not part of Jack’s plan to apprise Muller
of the identity of Mr. Johnson. He did not
wish to act prematurely in any way till he had
consulted Raynor and a plan of campaign had
been worked out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That guy certainly won’t try any monkey-shines
with me,” Muller assured Jack slangily,
but with a sincere ring in his voice, and Jack
knew he could trust him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he sought out Bill, whom he found in
the latter’s cabin writing letters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Bill,” he began. “I’ve solved the mystery
of Mr. Johnson.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill’s writing was instantly forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean that peppery chap?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same person. He’s an old friend of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
yours. You were not mistaken when you said
that you thought you recognized his voice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The dickens you say?” Bill was all attention
now. “And who is he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why,—as the nickel novels say,—none other
than our old college chum, Herr Professor Radwig.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For gracious’ sake!” Bill’s expression left no
doubt as to the genuineness of his astonishment.
“Old Earwig turned up again, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and from some not very complimentary
remarks he made about me, Bill,” continued
Jack, “I don’t think he’d be averse to doing me
some mischief, if he could.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’d better not try.” Bill doubled his fists
pugnaciously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The trouble is, I didn’t overhear enough to
find out just what his little game is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s too bad. It’s a shame we didn’t know
his identity earlier. We would have earned the
thanks of that English cruiser.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We certainly would. De Garros told me
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
that Radwig is accounted a very clever and dangerous
man. He has invented explosives and is
active in the entire German military movement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the way, where is de Garros?” asked Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know any more than you do. After
we left him at the depot in New York on our
return from Bar Harbor, I lost sight of him. In
fact, things have gone on with such a rush since
then, that I haven’t had time to think of him till
now. He told me, though, that he would take
the first ship possible to France.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, to get back to old Earwig.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you going to expose him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Expose him to whom?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The captain, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What would be the good? He has committed
no crime. If he wants to travel under a
false name that is not our business so long as he
does not interfere with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s true, but just the same, if we are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
boarded by another British cruiser, I’ll have
something to whisper in the boarding officer’s
ear,” said Bill, truculently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish we knew who this Schultz was,” confessed
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does that name appear on the passenger
lists?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On none of them. Besides, if it had, the man
would have been questioned by that officer from
the <em>Berwick</em>. He quizzed everybody with a
name that even sounded German.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s so,” admitted Bill; “he certainly went
through the ship with a rake. I guess old Earwig’s
friend has some American sounding name
that will carry him safe across the ocean no matter
what happens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after, Jack sought his berth in the wireless
room. As he approached the opened door
of the radio station, from which a flood of yellow
light issued, he saw, or thought he saw, two
lurking figures in the shadow of one of the boats.
But even as he sighted them, they vanished.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
For an instant, Jack assumed that they were
two of the boat crew but, as they scurried past
an open port, he saw they wore ordinary clothes
and not the sailor uniforms of the crew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Odd,” he mused. “Those fellows were certainly
hanging around the wireless room for no
good purpose. If they had been, they wouldn’t
have sneaked the instant they saw me coming.
I’m willing to bet a cookie one of them was Earwig
and the other his precious pal who understands
wireless. Jack, old boy, it’s up to you
to keep your eyes open.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anything doing?” he asked Muller, as he entered
the wireless room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a thing. Deader than a baseball park
on Christmas Day,” rejoined Muller.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t see anything of our friend, for instance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who, Johnson? No, he hasn’t been near
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack nodded good-night and then turned in.
But as the ship bored on through the darkness
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
his eyes refused, as they customarily did, to close
in his usual sound sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>His mind was busy with many things. It was
clear that Radwig was contemplating some use
of the wireless which did not yet seem quite
clear. That it was his duty to checkmate him
Jack was convinced, but as yet he had little to
go upon except the conversation overheard behind
the ventilator.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess watchful waiting will have to be the
policy,” he murmured to himself as he fell
asleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='chXII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br />THE ARMED CRUISER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The next morning, when Jack and Bill turned
out, there was quite a flutter among the passengers.
A large ship had been sighted in the distance,
coming rapidly westward. As she drew
nearer it could be seen that she was a monster
craft of four immense funnels painted a sombre
black without colored bands to relieve the effect.
Her upper works were a dull brown and
her hull, black.</p>

<p class='c009'>Speculation was rife concerning her identity,
but it soon became noised about that the craft
was the <em>Ruritania</em> of the Anglican Line, which
had, apparently, been converted into an auxiliary
cruiser by the English Government on the
outbreak of the war. The sight of guns mounted
on her fore and aft decks confirmed this.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
On she came, a fine, grim spectacle in her dull
paint. An absorbed shipload watched her, leaning
over the rails as she drew abreast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lie to!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The signals fluttered from her halliards and
the same order was flashed by wireless.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the second time the <em>St. Mark’s</em> engines
revolved more and more slowly. The two big
vessels lay opposite each other on the swells,
nodding solemnly. Before long a boat came
bobbing over the seas from the <em>Ruritania</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now’s your chance to give that fellow Earwig
up,” declared Raynor to Jack, as, leaning
in the door of the wireless room, they watched
the scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somehow it seems to me that would be a
shabby trick,” said Jack, after a moment’s
thought. “I’ll confess, though, that when the
<em>Ruritania</em> hove in sight such a thought came into
my mind. But—oh, well, I guess we’ll let him
get by this time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe you’ll be sorry for it later on,” said
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
Raynor, little guessing that those words were
prophetic. There was to come a time when Jack
was to bitterly regret having let Radwig escape
capture by the British.</p>

<p class='c009'>The inspection by the naval reserve officer of
the <em>Ruritania</em> did not vary from that which the
<em>St. Mark</em> had already undergone at the hands of
the <em>Berwick</em>. Naturally, the German reservists
having been already given up, there was little
to do but to overhaul the ship’s papers. This did
not take long, and before half an hour had
passed, the two steamships saluted each other
and parted company.</p>

<p class='c009'>That afternoon Jack had a visitor in the wireless
room. It was Mr. Johnson. He opened the
conversation ingratiatingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid I rather lost my temper the other
afternoon,” he said. “I want to apologize.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all right,” said Jack briefly, choking
back a longing to tell Mr. Johnson that he was
perfectly aware of his identity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—er—perhaps what I offered was not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
enough,” he continued. “I may tell you now
that I will double or triple the amount if you
will send a message for me,—using a code, of
course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack jumped to his feet, his eyes ablaze.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here, sir,” he shot out, “you might offer
me all the money there is in Germany but it
would not be of the slightest interest to me.
Now if you have nothing more to say, I’ll ask
you to leave this cabin before I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The angry boy checked himself with his
hands clenched and his eyes flashing. A murderous
look came into Mr. Johnson’s bearded
face, but he appeared to be determined to keep
himself in check.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not be foolish,” he urged; “have an eye
to your own interests. As for your reference
to Germany——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are going to say that you don’t understand
it,” cut in Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I must say I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t go any further,” interrupted the angry
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
young wireless boy, “and now ‘Mr. Johnson,’
or Herr Radwig, I’ll ask you to leave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Radwig looked for a moment as if he was
about to choke. His face turned purple and
his hands clenched and unclenched nervously.
The sweat stood out in tiny beads on his forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean——?” he began.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack leaned forward and looked at him significantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just this, Herr Professor, that in spite of that
fake beard and your dyed mustache, I know you.
Your reason for being disguised and going under
a false name is no business of mine <em>now</em>. See
that you don’t make it so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You—you——” sputtered the man who was
startled in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And furthermore,” continued Jack, “we are
likely to run across some more British ships. If
you annoy me any more, I shall point you out for
what you are. That will be all. Now go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Utterly bereft of words, Radwig turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
heavily and half fell out of the cabin. He collided
with Bill Raynor, who was just coming in. He
fairly snarled at Jack’s chum, who airily remarked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t slam the door when you’re going out!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You young whipper snapper, I—I——”
choked out Radwig, and being too discomfited
to find words, ended the sentence by shaking his
fist at the two boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Raynor, as Radwig vanished,
muttering angrily to himself, “it would appear
as if you’d spilled the beans, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does look that way, doesn’t it?” said Jack
with a smile. “I rather fancy our Teutonic
friend will be good for a while now.”</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br />A MESSAGE IN CODE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“What happened?” was Raynor’s next question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, he came in here and offered me untold
gold to send a code message for him. I fancy
that it was about the <em>Ruritania</em>, telling her
whereabouts and so on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So that was his game, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, he didn’t work it. I got mad and told
him that he needn’t bother to conceal his identity
from me, and that if he bothered me any
more I’d show him up to the first British officer
that again boarded us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phew! Going some. How did he take it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought he was going up like a balloon for
a minute,” laughed Jack. “Now, if we only
could identify Schultz, we’d have both of them
where we want them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
“That’s going to be a hard job,” declared Bill.
“They don’t go about together. At least, I’ve
watched closely, but never saw Radwig talking
with anyone on board.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I guess they keep pretty well under
cover for fear of accident. I wish I could have
gotten a look at them that night I overheard
them talking.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it would have simplified matters a good
deal,” Bill admitted, “but, as you say, I don’t
think either of them will try to bother us again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The day passed uneventfully. In the afternoon
they sighted a small British freighter making
her way west, and later on overtook a French
oil ship bound for Holland. Jack flashed them
the latest war news, for they had a small wireless
outfit, and in return received the information
that two German cruisers were somewhere
in the vicinity and that the French ship was in
fear of capture at any time.</p>

<p class='c009'>That evening the wind blew rather hard. A
high sea was whipped up by the gale and the <em>St.</em>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
<em>Mark</em>, big as she was, rolled and pitched violently.
It was what sea-faring men would have
called “a fresh breeze,” but to the passengers,
that is, such of them as were unseasoned travelers,
it was a veritable storm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack and Bill rather enjoyed the rough
weather, coming as it did after a monotonous
calm. After dinner they ascended to the boat
deck and paced up and down, chatting for some
time. Inside the wireless room Muller was at
the key. Now and then, as they passed and repassed,
they would exchange a word with him.
It was on one of these occasions that Muller
hailed them excitedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a ship just wirelessed the S. O. S.!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Scott,” cried Jack, “and on a night like
this. What’s the trouble?”’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t know yet. I’m trying to get them
again. Notify the captain, will you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the jump,” cried Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>He despatched his errand in a few minutes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
and was back in the wireless room with instructions
to “stand by” and get further information
as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anything new?” he asked Muller.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wireless man shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing but that first S. O. S.,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly there came a shout from Bill, who
was standing in the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look, Jack, what’s that off there?” he exclaimed,
pointing to the horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'>A dull glow was reflected against the night sky
in the direction he indicated. Now it flashed
bright as a blown furnace, and again it sank to
a faint glare. Jack was not long in deciding
what it was.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a ship on fire,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c009'>At almost the same moment a hoarse shout
from the forward lookout and a shouted reply
from the bridge told that the glare had been observed
from there, too.</p>

<p class='c009'>Possibly there is nothing at sea that thrills like
the sight of a vessel on fire. Jack, it will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
recalled, had witnessed such a spectacle before,
but yet his heart bounded as he watched the distant
glare now bright and glowing, now dull and
flickering.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo, the old man has rung for full speed
ahead!” exclaimed Bill, as the next moment the
<em>St. Mark’s</em> speed was perceptibly quickened and
her course changed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several seamen in charge of the third officer,
a Mr. Smallwood, came trampling aft. They
busied themselves loosening the fastenings of
one of the boats and getting it ready for launching.
Presently they were joined, and three additional
craft were made ready for the work of
life saving.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this time the glow had been getting
brighter as the <em>St. Mark</em> approached the burning
ship. But the distance was as yet too great
to make out what manner of vessel she was.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d give anything to get in one of those
boats,” observed Jack to Bill, as the two lads
watched the preparations for lowering away.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
“So would I,” agreed Bill. “Do you think
there’s a chance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. I ‘deadheaded’ a radio for
Mr. Smallwood to his sick mother the day we
sailed. That might have some influence with
him. I’ll ask him anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack vainly pleaded with the at first obdurate
officer, but after a long interval, he returned to
Bill with a smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all right,” he announced. “It was a hard
job to get him to consent. I won him over at
last. We go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurray!” cried Bill. “Now for some oilskins!
It’s not the sort of night to be without
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got mine in the cabin,” said Jack. “I’ll
borrow Muller’s for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good for you. Gosh! Look at those flames.
Seems to be a big steamer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Both boys paused a moment to look at the awe-inspiring
spectacle of the blazing ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they did so, something occurred which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
chilled the hot blood in their veins and caused
them to exchange startled, bewildered looks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Over the dark, heaving waters that divided
them from the blazing vessel there was borne
to their ears what sounded like an awful concerted
groan of agony. Again and again it
came, rising and falling in a terrible rhythm.
It was not human. It sounded like the sufferings
of demons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wow! But that’s fearful!” exclaimed Bill,
paling. “What under the sun can it be?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br />THE CATTLE SHIP.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The awesome sound continued while the boats
were being lowered. The weird nature of the
uproar and its mystery made even the rough seamen
apprehensive. The more religious among
them crossed themselves fervently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad cess to it, if it don’t sound like the howling
of poor sowls in purgathory,” muttered one
of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the boat in which he and Bill were sitting
beside Mr. Smallwood was lowered, Jack
glanced upward and had a view of the lighted
decks, the rails being lined with the heads of curious
and excited passengers. Then came a sickening
swing outward as the ship rolled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let go all or we’ll be smashed!” shouted Mr.
Smallwood.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
For a moment, as the ship heaved back, it
seemed indeed, as if the boat was doomed to be
dashed against her steel sides and smashed into
splinters. But in the nick of time the “falls”
were let go “all standing.” The boat rushed
downward and struck the top of a great wave
with a force that shook her. The next instant,
the patent blocks opened and on the crest of the
great comber Mr. Smallwood’s boat, and the
others, were swept off into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Behind them arose a mighty cheer, but they
hardly noticed it in the excitement and danger
of the launching.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A bad night for this work,” muttered Mr.
Smallwood as the boat was lifted heavenward
and then rushed down into a dark profundity
from which it seemed impossible she could
emerge. A blood red glow from the leaping
flames enveloping the stern of the doomed craft,
which was a large, single funneled steamer, lay
on the roughened sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are there passengers on board, do you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
think?” asked Jack, rather tremulously, as the
blood-chilling uproar from the burning vessel
continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looks to me more like a freighter—hard
there on the bow-oars,—meet that sea,—she has
no upper decks,” replied the third officer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see anybody on board her, either,”
said Bill, after an interval, during which the
boat escaped swamping, as it seemed to the boys,
by a miracle only.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s hope they got away,” said the third
officer, “but that devil’s concert on board beats
me. It’s not human, that’s one sure thing.
What in blazes is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It gives me the shivers,” confessed Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>The noise grew positively deafening as they
got closer. The intense heat of the blaze and the
shower of falling embers that enveloped them
added to their discomfort.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Row toward the bow,” roared Mr. Smallwood,
cupping his hands, “or we’ll have the
boats afire next.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
Already several of the seamen had hastily extinguished
portions of their clothing that had
caught, and burns on hands and faces were plentiful.
But as they pulled toward the blazing
craft’s bow, this annoyance was avoided, the
wind blowing the heat and embers from them.</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once, as they swung upward on the
crest of an immense comber, Jack uttered a
shout:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The mystery’s solved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” demanded Mr. Smallwood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The mystery of that horrible noise. That’s
a cattle ship yonder, and the poor beasts are
mad with fear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The next wave gave them a clear view of tossing
horns and heads as the unfortunate cattle,
penned on the burning craft, rushed madly
about the decks, in vain seeking some means of
relief. It was a piteous sight, for there was no
way of saving them from being burned alive unless
the ship sank first.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
“Oh, but that’s awful!” gasped Jack, with a
shudder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look, look up on the bow!” cried Bill suddenly.
“There’s a man. He’s seen us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s waving,” cried Mr. Smallwood. “Hurrah!
Give way, men! There’s a poor beggar
roasting on that ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the boat’s crew needed no urging. In the
lee of the burning cattle ship the water was
smoother and they could make better time. Silhouetted
against the glare, too, every man of
them could see, by a twist of his head, that solitary
marooned figure on the bow of the fire
ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the first boat,—Mr. Smallwood’s,—ranged
in alongside the high steel prow, Jack’s quick eye
caught sight of a rope dangling from the great
steel anchor chains. By what impulse he did it
he could not have explained, but as the boat
ranged close alongside he poised for an instant
on the heaving gunwale and then launched his
body forward into space.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
“Come back, boy!” shouted Mr. Smallwood.
But by the time the words had left his mouth,
Jack was scrambling up the rope amidst the
cheers of the men in the tossing boats now far
below him. It was the work of a few moments
only to gain the anchor chain, and to climb up
them was, for a lad of Jack’s brawn and activity,
an easy task.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank heaven you came before it was too
late,” cried the solitary man on the fore deck,
staggering toward the boy with outstretched
arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you the only man on board?” demanded
the boy, deciding to leave explanations till later.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Dick Sanders is sick in his bunk below.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where, down this hatchway? In the forecastle?”
asked Jack quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I was too weak to carry him up, heaven
help me,” muttered the other reeling weakly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack did not stop to listen. He knew that
within a few minutes his shipmates would be on
board and would rescue the half-crazed man on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
the bow. It was his duty to go after the sick
man below. Into the ill-smelling darkness of
the forecastle of the cattle ship he plunged,
clawing his way down an iron ladder. At the
bottom he struck a match. As its light flared
up he heard a groan, and looking in the direction
from which it came he espied the emaciated
form of a boy lying in a bunk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you come to save me?” gasped out the
sick lad, who was almost a skeleton and whose
eyes glowed with unnatural brightness in his
parchment-like face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but you must do exactly what I tell
you,” instructed Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will, oh, I will,” choked out the other.
“Only save me. I was afraid I was going to be
left here to die alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t talk about dying now,” ordered Jack.
“Now clasp your arms round my neck and hold
on tight. Do you think you can keep your grip
till we get to the top of that ladder?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—that is, I think so,” returned the sick
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
lad, who had been cabin boy on the doomed
ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, hold on,” ordered Jack as, having carried
his pitifully light burden across the forecastle
to the foot of the ladder, he prepared to
ascend the rounds. Once or twice he had to stop
on the way up, and holding on with one hand,
grasp Dick Sanders with his other arm to allow
the lad to recruit his strength. At last they
reached the deck and Jack, who was almost exhausted,
laid his frail burden down with a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked about for his companions, who he
fully expected to see on the forecastle. There
was no sign of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lone man who had waved to them from
the bow had also vanished. A rope ladder, one
end of which was secured inboard, showed the
way they had gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Queer that they didn’t wait for me,” muttered
Jack. “They must have known I was
below. I wonder——”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
There was a sudden warning shout from
somewhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look out for your life!” came in Mr. Smallwood’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack looked up, startled. The burning ship
was a flush-decked craft. That is, her forecastle
was not raised, but was on a level with the main
deck where the cattle pens were. The terrified
creatures, in their frenzy of fear, had broken
loose from the flimsy timber structure, and
now, urged on by the flames behind them, were
charging down in a wild stampede upon Jack
and the half-conscious form of the sick boy at
his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not possible to effect a retreat down the
forecastle hatch, for his efforts to support himself
on the journey up had been too much for
Dick Sanders’ strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack looked about him. It was imperative to
act with desperate swiftness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, not fifty feet from him was the advance
guard of the maddened, fear-crazed steers. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
a few seconds, if he did not act swiftly, both he
and the lad he had rescued would be pounded
by their sharp hoofs into an unrecognizable
mass.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly he formed a resolution. With desperate
eagerness he stripped off his oilskins and
kicked off the light deck shoes he had not
thought to change in the hurry of embarkment.
Then, picking up the fragile form of Dick in
his arms, he sped for the side of the forecastle.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the long-horned steers swept down so close
to him that he could feel their breaths and see
the whites of their frenzied eyes, the boy leaped
up and outward into the night.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c007'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br />JACK’S BRAVE LEAP.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>What happened after the leap, Jack never
knew clearly. He felt a wild, half-suffocating
rush through the air and then a sensation of
choking and strangling as a cold, stifling weight
of water pressed in on him. Down, down, down
he plunged. It seemed as if he would never rise.
In his ears was an intolerable drumming.
Everything was blood-red before his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came a sudden blast of blessed air, following
a swift upward rush, and he found himself
struggling in the wild sea with Dick Sanders
clinging desperately to him and almost making
him go under again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Luckily Jack, without conscious thought, had
chosen the lee side of the burning ship, where
the boats hovered, for his leap for two lives.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
As his head appeared above the surface, the
bright glare of the flames showed his form
clearly to the anxious watchers who had witnessed
his daring dive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There he is! Hurrah!” shouted Bill Raynor,
who was the first to see him. “Hold on, Jack,
old boy, we’ll be with you in just a second.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep up your heart! We’ll get you!” bellowed
Mr. Smallwood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack essayed a feeble wave in response, with
the result that he was once more engulfed. But
in a few moments he was safe and a dozen pairs
of strong arms had drawn him and Dick Sanders
into Mr. Smallwood’s boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heavens, lad, what a dive,” cried the third
mate admiringly, when Jack was somewhat recovered
and Dick lay covered with seamen’s
coats on the floor of the boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gracious, we thought you were a goner!” exclaimed
Raynor, “when the cattle made the first
charge. I guess you didn’t hear it, being below.
We all came close to being caught. The man
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
on the forecastle, who was unconscious by the
time we got on board, was reached in time to
be lowered into one of the boats. In the confusion,
we thought you were among us. It was not
till we reached the boats again that we found
our mistake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the meantime,” said Mr. Smallwood,
“those poor devils of steers had reached the rail
and not liking the look of the water any better
than the fire, charged back again. It was just
as the second ‘wave,’ as you might call it, was
coming for you that we saw you weren’t with
us. Suddenly we sighted you with that poor kid
there,” he nodded to the bottom of the boat,
“right in the line of their charge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it hadn’t been for your warning shout, I
might not have been here now,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I saw that and so I yelled with all my
power,” said the third officer, “but lad,” he went
on, slapping Jack on the back, “when I saw what
you were going to do, I regretted having warned
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
“It was the only thing to do,” said Jack. “We
wouldn’t have stood a chance if we had remained
where we were,” and he explained that
it was impossible to find shelter on the flush
deck or to retreat back into the forecastle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, all’s well that ends well,” said Mr.
Smallwood, “but it gave me a turn when I saw
you come sky-hottling off that bow. But,—great
Christmas,—look yonder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He pointed back at the burning ship. By her
own light they saw her pitch heavily forward,
hesitate an instant and then, without further
warning, and amidst a piteous bellowing that
sounded like a death-wail, shoot downward to
the depths of the ocean. In an instant the light
she had spread across the rough sea had vanished,
and by contrast, the night appeared to
have suddenly solidified about them in velvety
blackness. A moment later a blinding white
light groped across the waste of tossing waters
and enveloped them in its glow. It was the
searchlight of the <em>St. Mark</em> and it accompanied
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
them with its cheering light till they reached the
ship’s side.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were greeted amid acclamation, and
Dick Sanders was at once taken charge of by
the ship’s doctor and some lady passengers. The
man who had been rescued had, by this time,
however, sufficiently recovered to accompany
Mr. Smallwood, Bill and Jack to Captain Jameson’s
cabin, where that officer was eagerly waiting
to hear the details of the rescue.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rescued sailor, whose name was Mark
Cherry, soon told them the story of the disaster
to the <em>Buffalonian</em>, a British cattle ship
which had left New York for London several
days previously. Early that evening the craft
had been overtaken by a German cruiser and
ordered to surrender. Every one on board was
made prisoner, and some of the cattle taken,
when the British captain, seized by a sudden fit
of anger, struck the German commander in the
face. He was instantly ironed, as were his officers,
Mark Cherry observing all this from under
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
the cover of a boat where he had been working
when the cruiser took the cattle craft, and in
which he had remained hidden.</p>

<p class='c009'>In revenge, apparently, for the British captain’s
attack on him, the German commander
had, on his return to his own ship, ordered the
<em>Buffalonian</em> fired upon by the big guns. The
hidden sailor crouched in terror in his place of
concealment while the cannon boomed. He
thought his last hour had come. The projectiles
shrieked through the sternworks of the ship
and one, he thought, had struck amidships
(which accounted for the vessel’s foundering).</p>

<p class='c009'>At length, appearing to tire of this, the German
cruiser put about and steamed away.
Cherry crept from his hiding place where he
had remained paralyzed with fright throughout
the bombardment, and making for the wireless
room sent out the only signal he knew, the
S. O. S., which he had learned from a friendly
wireless man, in case there ever came a time
when it would be a matter of life and death to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
him to use it. This explained why no answer
came to Muller’s frantic calls after the first distress
signal.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was only a few moments after this call that
flames burst from the shattered stern, and
Cherry knew that unless help came, his hours
were numbered. So confused and terrified was
he by his desperate situation, that it was not till
Jack’s appearance on the scene, he remembered
little Dick Sanders, the cabin boy, lying sick in
his bunk below. (It may be said here that with
care and good treatment the lad quickly recovered
his health, and he and Mark Cherry were
put to work with the crew of the <em>St. Mark</em>.)
Thus, without further incident, the English
Channel was reached and Jack began busily to
try to communicate with the firm’s London
agents for instructions as to docking orders.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br />AWAITING ORDERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>While awaiting orders, which the wireless
had told the <em>St. Mark’s</em> captain were not ready
for transmission, the big liner stood “off and on”
at the mouth of the channel. It was wearing
work, and all looked forward eagerly to the day
when their destination would be settled and they
could proceed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack felt the monotony of it no less than anyone
else on board, but he spent a good many
busy hours perfecting an attachment for a wireless
coherer which he hoped would prove of
great value in the future, and possibly prove as
profitable as the Universal Detector, to which
allusion has already been made in “The Ocean
Wireless Boys” and “The Naval Code.” One
night, after working for some time at some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
rather abstruse calculations in this connection,
he decided to abandon the work for the night
and take a stroll on deck before turning in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Raynor, he knew, was finishing up the last of
a series of match games of checkers, so he did
not bother to look up his friend. Knowing that
Bill was busily engaged, Jack was rather surprised
when, at his fourth or fifth turn up and
down the deck, which was almost deserted, a
steward stepped up to him with a note.</p>

<p class='c009'>It proved to be from Raynor and read as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Jack:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Meet me at once in the stern where we can
talk without being spied on. The steward will
show you where. I have something important
to tell you about Radwig.</p>

<div class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Bill.</span>”</div>

<p class='c010'>“This is very peculiar,” mused Jack, and then,
turning to the steward he asked:</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
“Did Mr. Raynor give you this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir, and he told me to bring you to where
he was waiting, sir,” was the obsequious response.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, lead on,” said Jack and then to
himself he added: “I can’t in the least make out
why old Bill should be so secretive. I might
just as well have met him in his cabin. But
maybe he is being watched, and thinks the place
he has appointed would be better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The steward led the way aft through a maze
of corridors and passages. At last they arrived
far in the stern of the ship where the unlighted
passages showed no cabins were occupied. The
twenty first-class passengers had all been booked
amidships, thus the hundreds of cabins opening
on the stern passages were unoccupied and nobody
went near them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve no idea why Mr. Raynor selected this
part of the ship to meet me?” said Jack, as he
followed the man who lighted the way with an
electric torch.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
“No, sir,” he replied, with a shake of his head.
“I suppose he had his reasons, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No doubt, but this is an odd part of the ship
to keep an appointment,” said Jack. “We must
be far away from the occupied cabins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, sir. Almost a tenth of a mile. Wonderful,
ain’t it, sir, the size of these big ships?
A fellow could yell his lungs out in this part of
the vessel, sir, and things, being as they are, and
the cabins empty and all, nobody could hear
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose not,” said Jack idly. “Are we
nearly there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir. Just turn down this passage, sir.
Right to the left, sir, mind that step and—”
Crash!</p>

<p class='c009'>A great burst of light, as if a sudden explosion
had occurred in front of him blinded Jack, and
at the same instant he felt a violent blow on the
back of the head. Then the bright light vanished
with a loud report and he seemed to swim
for an instant, in blackness. Everything went
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
out, as if a light had been switched off, and the
lad pitched heavily forward on his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good, that will settle his hash for a while,”
muttered a voice, and Radwig, a short, wicked-looking
bludgeon in his hand, bent over the
senseless boy. By the German’s side was another
man, a short, thick-set, clean-shaven fellow
with a projecting jaw, known on the passenger
list as Mr. Duncan Ewing, of Chicago.</p>

<p class='c009'>The light of the steward’s torch illumined
their faces as they stood above the recumbent
young wireless boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, sir,” muttered the man, “I know you’ve
paid me well and all, sir, but I didn’t bargain for
no murdering business, sir. I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be an idiot,” snapped Radwig impatiently.
“We haven’t hurt him. See, he’s beginning
to stir. Now then, Schultz——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Radwig bent and took up the limp body by
the head while Mr. Duncan Ewing, who answered
with alacrity to the name of Schultz,
laid hold of poor Jack by the feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
“Now, steward,” said Radwig, as they carried
their burden into an empty cabin, “keep a stiff
upper lip till we dock, and then I don’t care
what happens. You’ll be well taken care of.
Don’t forget that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir, I know, sir,” said the man, whose
hand was trembling as he held the torch; “but
I don’t like the business, sir. If it wasn’t for my
poor wife being sick and needing the money,
and all—-”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will do. Go get us the lamp you promised.
In the meantime we’ll revive this young
fellow and show you that he’s not dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>From a carafe of stale water that stood on the
washstand, Radwig dashed a liberal application
in Jack’s face. He loosened the lad’s collar and
chafed his wrists. Jack moaned, stirred, and
opened his eyes. For a moment his swimming
senses refused to rally to his call. Then, with a
flash, he realized what had happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Radwig, you scoundrel!” he exclaimed,
“what is the meaning of this outrage?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
“Just a delicate little way of reminding you
that it is not well to thwart the wishes of Herr
Professor Radwig,” was the reply. “Schultz,
my dear fellow, shut that door. No, wait a moment,
here comes our man with the lamp. That’s
better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took the lamp from the steward, and set
it in a frame on the wall provided for it in case
the electric light failed from any cause. The
steward, still pale and shaky, hurried away after
one glance at Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now,” said Radwig, “we will leave you
to your reflections, my young friend. It will do
you no good to shout. Under present conditions
this part of the ship is uninhabited. No
one comes near it. As for trying to force the
door after we have gone, it would be wasted
labor. I have taken the pains to affix bolts to the
outside of it. Bread you will find, and some
water, under the bunk. I advise you to be sparing
of it, for you will not get any more and now—<em>auf
wiedersehn</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
He opened the door, motioned Schultz out,
and turned a malevolent smile on the boy. With
a shout, Jack flung himself forward, but the
door slammed in his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>He heard a laugh from outside, a laugh that
made his blood boil and his fists clench. He fell
against the door and wrenched at it furiously.
But already the bolts outside had been shot into
place and the portal held firmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now don’t lose your temper,” begged Radwig
mockingly from without; “it’s very bad,
very bad for the digestion. I would recommend
you to spend your time mediating over the manifest
advantages of being obliging. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack, listening at the bolted door, heard their
footsteps die away down the deserted passageway.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br />WHAT BEFELL IN THE AFTER CABIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Man overboard!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill, making his way along the deck to the
wireless room companionway, heard the thrilling
cry and joined the rush of passengers to the
stern rail from whence the shout had come.
Radwig and Schultz stood there with every expression
of alarm on their faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>The captain came hurrying up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it? What’s the matter?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somebody fell overboard,” declared Radwig;
“we heard a splash and hastened here at
once to cut loose a life belt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lower a boat at once,” commanded the captain;
“slow down the engines.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The petty officer to whom the command had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
been given, hurried off at top speed to the bridge
while the captain asked more questions of Radwig
and his companion. But they could tell
nothing more definite than that they had heard
a splash and a cry and that was all. They had
not seen who was the victim of the accident.</p>

<p class='c009'>The captain decided to call a roll of passengers
and crew at once. While the boat was lowered,
and was rowed to and fro, on the dark
waters, this work went on. When it was over,
there was only one person on board found to be
missing. This was, of course, Jack Ready. The
cunning of Radwig had evolved this clever plan
to obviate the search that would be surely made
on the ship for the imprisoned young wireless
lad when his absence from duty was discovered.
If the lad was believed to be drowned, of course,
no effort would be made to find him on board
and he and Schultz would be safe from the results
of their rascality. It was a clever though
simple scheme and it worked to perfection, for
after an hour of investigation the captain was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
forced to conclude that Jack had, in some inexplicable
manner, fallen overboard and had perished.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there was one person on board who did
not accept this theory, and that was Bill Raynor.
By no figuring could he bring himself to
believe that Jack had fallen into the sea. In the
first place, the rail was almost breast high, and
in the second, Jack was too good a sailor to have
lost his head and toppled from the ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am convinced he’ll turn up,” he told Mullen
in the wireless room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but a thorough search was made for
him without result,” objected the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, something seems to tell me that
he is all right,” protested Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid you are deluding yourself,” said
Mullen, shaking his head. “When he fell overboard——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean <em>if</em> he fell overboard,” interrupted
Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you surely don’t doubt that!”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
exclaimed Mullen; “a splash is heard and following
that a canvass of the ship shows that Jack
Ready is missing. If he wasn’t drowned, where
is he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I admit that it sounds like a poser,” said Bill.
“See here, I’m not absolutely certain that he did
go overboard at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” Mullen stared at Raynor as if he
thought he had suddenly been bereft of his
senses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean what I say,” repeated Bill slowly.
“I’m not sure that he did go overboard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In that case he must be on board the ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why should he be hiding?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s not hiding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why doesn’t he show up?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because he’s been hidden,” replied Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that’s too fantastic an idea,” cried Mullen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it sounds wild—almost crazy, in fact,
but I simply cannot help feeling it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
“I wish I could think the same way,” said
Mullen, and the tone of his voice left no room
to doubt that he meant what he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime, how was it with Jack? Confined
in the stuffy cabin, lighted only by the
smoky lamp, his head ached intolerably from
the cruel blow that had been dealt him. In fact,
it was not till the following morning that he felt
himself again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neither of the men who had made him a prisoner
came near the cabin in which he was confined,
and although he tried shouting for aid till
his throat was sore, nobody appeared to hear
him. The boy began to be seriously alarmed
over his predicament.</p>

<p class='c009'>Radwig had told him in so many words, that
neither he nor Schultz intended to return to the
cabin. The water and bread left him would not
suffice for more than a few hours. By the time
the cabin was entered by some employee of the
ship, it was entirely probable that the aid would
come too late. Luckily for him, his mental
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
anguish was not increased by knowledge of the
story of his death by drowning that had circulated
through the ship. Had he known of this,
it is likely that, plucky as the lad was, he would
have given way entirely to despair.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cabin was an inside one, so that there was
no porthole through which he could project his
head and call for aid. Examination of the small
chamber, even to the length of pulling up the
carpet, showed that there was no means of escape
short of forcing open the door and that
Jack, strong as he was, was unable to accomplish,
although he wore out his muscles trying
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hours passed by with dragging feet until
it seemed to the boy that he must have been in
the bolted cabin for years instead of hours. The
lamp guttered and went out, leaving him
plunged in pitchy darkness. It was the last
straw. Jack flung himself on the bunk and buried
his head in his hands. How long he lay thus
he did not know, but he was aroused and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
heart set suddenly in a wild flutter by the sound
of approaching footsteps and voices.</p>

<p class='c009'>He shouted aloud:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Help, for heaven’s sake, help!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he sat silent, hardly daring to believe
that there was a possibility of his rescue. More
probably the voices and footsteps were those of
Radwig and his rascally accomplice.</p>

<p class='c009'>In an agony of apprehension, Jack sat in the
darkness waiting for the answer to his cry for
aid.</p>

  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br />A RASCAL BROUGHT TO BOOK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We must now go back to an occurrence that
happened earlier in the evening. The ship had
finally received orders to dock at Southampton
and was proceeding at a fast clip up the
Channel when the telephone in the wireless
room rang and a voice inquired for Bill Raynor.
Summoned to the wire by Mullen, Bill, who
had just entered the station after a miserable day
of anxiety for Jack, replied and found that he
had been called by the ship’s surgeon, Dr.
Moore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There has been an accident,” said the doctor;
“one of the men has been badly injured. He
says he wants to see you without delay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I know none of the crew,” said Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This man evidently knows you, however,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
returned the doctor, “and I wish you would come
as soon as possible. He appears to be worrying
over something and says he cannot rest till he
has seen you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Greatly mystified, Bill obeyed the summons.
On entering the doctor’s cabin he saw, stretched
on the lower bunk, and swathed in bandages, the
figure of a man who turned a pair of sunken eyes
on him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One of the stewards,” whispered the doctor.
“Poor fellow. Badly scalded in the galley.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned to the sufferer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is Mr. Raynor, whom you wanted to
see,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let him come here,” said the man feebly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill approached the man’s side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What can I do for you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to ease my conscience of a great burden.
Bend low so that you can hear me. It
hurts when I talk loud.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill bent over the pitiable, bandaged form.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you want to tell me?” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
“That your friend, Mr. Ready, is a prisoner
on this steamer,” was the reply that brought an
exclamation of amazement from Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was half-inclined to believe the man was
delirious for an instant, but a moment later revised
this opinion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know this?” he asked, when he
had recovered from his astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I helped the plotters who put him there,”
moaned the man. “They were Germans, like
myself, and they told me that if he was not shut
up he would betray them to the English authorities
as soon as the ship docked. They gave me
money and I let them have the key to a cabin
far in the stern of the vessel. They forged a note
to him and trapped him when, in answer to it,
I led him to where they were waiting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And he is there now?” cried Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man nodded slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So far as I know. They had screwed bolts
on the door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was not hurt?” demanded Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
“Not seriously; but they struck him on the
head.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The brutes,” cried Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know who they were, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can guess—a man named Radwig and another
named Schultz.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The bandaged man nodded again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have named them correctly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doctor!” exclaimed Bill, “you have heard
what this man has said. Can you leave him long
enough to go with me to Captain Jameson?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gladly, my boy. But of all extraordinary
tales——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is true, upon my word of honor,” groaned
the injured man. “The number of the cabin is
14. The chief steward has the keys. I stole
them from his desk to open the stateroom and
placed them back again without his knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And just to think,” muttered Bill, as he and
the doctor hastened from the injured man’s side,
“that if it had not been for that accident we’d
never have known a thing about poor old Jack’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
plight till too late. After all, that feeling I had
was correct.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Jameson summoned the chief steward
as soon as he had heard Bill’s story and together
the commander, and the others, hastened through
the maze of corridors leading to stateroom 14.
Theirs were the voices the boy had heard, and
in ten minutes’ time he was wringing Bill’s hand
and telling, to an indignant group, the story of
Radwig’s outrage.</p>

<p class='c009'>The captain’s indignation knew no bounds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll have those rascals in irons before we drop
anchor!” he exclaimed. “We are nearing Southampton
now and if that man had not met with
his accident they might have landed and escaped
scot free.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack was weakened by his trying experience,
but he was not too exhausted not to be able to
accompany the officer to Radwig’s cabin. A
knock on the door brought an immediate answer:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
“Keep back,” whispered the captain to Jack,
“I want to see how far these rascals will incriminate
themselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Accordingly, Jack and the others kept out of
sight as the door was opened and Captain Jameson
stepped inside, but as the portal was left
ajar, they could hear what went on within.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know my friend, Mr. Ewing,” said Radwig,
in oily tones, indicating Schultz, who, it
will be recalled, had adopted that alias, and who
was seated in Radwig’s cabin engaged over a
valise full of papers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The captain bowed his acknowledgment of the
introduction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And to what am I to attribute the honor of
this visit?” said Radwig. “Possibly something
connected with the formalities of landing? I
am informed we shall be in harbor in a short
time now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is correct,” said the captain bruskly,
“and we shall land minus one of the ship’s company.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
“You mean poor young Ready, the wireless
operator,” said Radwig. “It was too bad about
that unfortunate lad. If my friend and myself
had been a few seconds earlier we might have
saved him before he went overboard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, of all the precious hypocrites,” gasped
Bill under his breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He takes the grand trophy,” breathed Jack,
who had been told of the cleverly arranged story
of his death that had been circulated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is not a question but that he is
drowned, I’m afraid,” came from Schultz the
next minute. Then was heard the captain’s voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, yes, gentlemen, there is,” he said; “in
fact, there is every question for <em>here he is</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As if he had been an actor answering his
“cue,” Jack stepped into the lighted doorway.
At the sight of him, the two miscreants shrank
back as if they had seen a ghost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’m real enough, Messrs. Radwig and
Schultz,” smiled Jack, as the others crowded in
behind him.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
“And it will be my duty to hand you both over
to the British authorities,” snapped the captain
to the speechless pair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Radwig made a sudden dart for the valise full
of documents. His move was so unexpected that
before they could stop him he had hurled it out
through the open porthole. Then, with a snarl
of rage, he flung himself at Jack. But the captain’s
erect figure interposed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stand where you are,” he ordered, and Radwig
found himself looking into the muzzle of a
revolver.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold out your hands,” he ordered and cringing,
the two miscreants obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jones,” he added, addressing the chief steward,
“oblige me by slipping those handcuffs on
the men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The click of the steel bracelets appeared to
arouse Radwig to speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You—you—young whelp,” he shouted, shaking
his manacled fists at Jack. “Whatever may
be my fate, I’ll remember you and see that you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
are attended to if it takes every penny and
every resource I have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Violence won’t do you any good,” commented
the captain quietly, “and if I know anything
of the English law you are apt to spend
quite some time in Great Britain. Jones, march
the prisoners to the smoking room and detain
them there till the ship docks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sullenly, the two prisoners shuffled out of the
cabin and were marched past wondering passengers
to their place of detention. Three
hours later, when the ship docked, the boys saw
them being taken ashore by British officials.
A thorough ransacking of their cabin had failed
to reveal any incriminating documents, although
the valise which Radwig had hurled out of the
porthole undoubtedly had contained such papers.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Southampton they learned that the <em>St.
Mark</em> was likely to be tied up for some time.
Rumors of mines and torpedoes made the owners
unwilling to risk her loss. The two lads,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
therefore, left the vessel, and proceeded to London,
where their instructions were to visit agents
of the line and learn if anything had been heard
of Tom Jukes. They found the city thronged
with marching soldiers and territorials, while
everywhere proclamations calling on the men of
England to enlist were posted. Otherwise, however,
everything appeared to be going on as if
there were no war.</p>

<p class='c009'>Inquiry at the agents resulted in a meagre
clue to the whereabouts of the lad of whom they
were in search. He had wired for funds from
Malines, a Belgian town, a few days before war
was declared and the Germans invaded Belgium.
Since then nothing had been heard of
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The magnitude of their task appeared greater
than ever to the two lads now that they had actually
started the work. But Jack was not the
sort of lad to give up at the first difficulty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll go to Belgium,” he announced, but
right here a stumbling block appeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
There were no longer regular steamers running
to Belgian ports, and the small and infrequent
craft that did venture had been warned
by the Admiralty that the North Sea was
thickly sown with mines. It was a journey
full of peril but, nothing daunted, Jack and Bill
journeyed to Grimsby, a town on the east coast,
where they were told they might be able to engage
passage on a trawler, provided they could
find a captain adventurous enough to take them
across.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this took up valuable time, for in the confusion
and turmoil of war time, business was
harder to transact than in normal times. Two
days were consumed in London, but on the evening
of the second they started for Grimsby. As
they took their seats in the train, a newsboy came
along shouting “War Extras.” They bought
some of his papers and settled back to read them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, here’s an encouraging item,” said Bill
ironically, as the train moved out. He pointed
to a despatch headed:</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
“Trawler destroyed by mines in the North
Sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have to take our chances,” decided
Jack, “but, hullo—what’s this?” he exclaimed
suddenly; “listen here, Bill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He read excitedly from his paper:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The two prisoners arrested as German military
agents on the arrival of the American liner
<em>St. Mark</em> at Southampton two days ago have, in
some mysterious manner, escaped. Four of their
guards are under arrest. It is hinted that bribery
was used to effect the Germans’ liberty.”</p>

  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br />THE “BARLEY RIG.”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was with Captain Hoeseason of the trawler
<em>Barley Rig</em> that the boys finally succeeded in
striking a bargain to land them in Antwerp. The
captain of the craft, who was also her owner,
was a giant of a man, more than six feet tall in
his great sea boots and dressed in rough fisherman’s
garb. The boys found him in a small,
waterfront inn, with a thatched roof and red
window curtains which bore the sign of the Magpie
and Shark, apparently, in the owner’s estimation,
a happy combination of land and sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Hoeseason declared that he knew the
North Sea like a book and that there would be
no danger of encountering mines if they sailed
with him. His craft would be ready at the long
fish dock at six the next morning, he declared,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
and at that hour the boys presented themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The crew of the <em>Barley Rig</em> were a rough,
weather-beaten looking set of men, and almost
immediately, upon the boy’s arrival, they set to
work, under the hoarsely bawled orders of Captain
Hoeseason, setting the fisher craft’s great
red sails. At last all was ready. Under a brisk
breeze, that momentarily grew stronger, the
trawler slipped out to sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re a rough-looking lot on this craft,”
observed Jack to Bill, as the <em>Barley Rig</em> began
to toss about in a way that would have been trying
to less experienced sailors.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I’m glad you’ve got that money in your
money-belt,” said Bill, referring to the American
gold they carried. “They have none of
them seen it, thank goodness, or we might have
cause to worry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t know,” declared Jack. “They
may be honest enough for all their rough looks.
I imagine that the North Sea fishery doesn’t
tend to make men very refined looking.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
“At all events it hasn’t had that effect on this
crew,” laughed Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>At noon they were summoned, by the cook’s
beating on a tin pan, to a dinner of fried fish
and boiled potatoes. The little cabin where they
ate it reeked of the fish that for years had
formed the <em>Barley Rig’s</em> cargo, and was lighted,
for it had no openings but the companionway
above, by a swinging, smoking lamp of what was
known among the fishermen as the “pot” variety.
But it would have taken more than this
to dull the keen edges of the boys’ appetites,
whet to razor sharpness by the freshening wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cook, an old, bent man, with a wild blue
eye, stood by his rusty stove watching as they
devoured what was set before them. Overhead
they could hear the trample of feet and the occasional
impact of a big wave as it broke in
spray over the bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s getting rougher,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seems to be,” agreed Bill; “this is a small
boat to be out in a storm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
“They say that the trawlers are fine sea boats,”
declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no doubt that it was getting
rougher. By mid-afternoon the green seas with
breaking, white tops, were leaping mountainously
under a scudding gray sky. Still, the captain
of the <em>Barley Rig</em> did not take in a reef of
his sails. He stood beside the tiller, which was
gripped by a young giant of a fisher in jersey and
boots, giving an occasional order and puffing vigorously
at his stubby clay pipe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beside an occasional gruff word, Captain
Hoeseason did not have much to say to his passengers,
but they noticed that his eyes followed
them constantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t shake off an idea that the fellow has
some mischief in mind,” declared Bill, after he
had noticed the furtive scrutiny the skipper of
the <em>Barley Rig</em> was bestowing on them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense,” declared Jack. “I made a few
inquiries about him and he appears to bear a
good character. Anyhow, we are going among
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
dangers beside which this trip won’t appear as
anything, so don’t get nervous at the start off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As dusk began to settle down, it showed a wild
scene. The trawler appeared to be alone on the
troubled ocean; at least, no other craft was
within sight. The wind howled dismally
through the cordage, and the reefed sails tore at
their ropes as if they would part at any moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad weather, Captain,” said Jack, as he and
Bill stood bracing themselves against a back
stay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, aye,” rejoined the captain, taking out his
pipe like a stopper to permit himself speech,
“but she’ll be worse afore she gits better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was right. By nightfall, it was blowing a
gale, and the big seas were breaking over the
<em>Barley Rig</em>, drenching everything. Water fell
in cataracts down the cabin companionway every
time the hatch was opened. Cooking was impossible,
and the boys made their supper on hard
ship biscuit and water while a small flood
washed about their feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
“This is awful, Jack,” remarked Bill after a
lurch that had sent him sliding across the cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cheer up, old fellow, it might be worse,”
retorted Jack cheerily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill gave a groan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see how it could be, unless we go to
the bottom,” Bill grumbled dismally. “You
don’t think there’s any danger of that, Jack, do
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a bit of it. This craft has weathered
many a storm as bad or worse than this, I don’t
doubt,” declared Jack stoutly, although the laboring
of the storm-stricken <em>Barley Rig</em> was beginning
to get on his nerves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not long after the completion of their scanty
meal, the captain came below and snatched a
bite. He was dripping from head to foot and
reported the gale as increasing in violence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My advice to you younkers is to turn in,” he
said. “You can have my bunk—that one yonder.
I’ll be on deck all night and so will ’tother lads.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The bunk in question was not much more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
a shelf with some very dubious-looking blankets
piled untidily on it. But the boys were tired, and
so they clambered up and composed themselves
to rest with the deck within a foot of their faces,
so low was the cabin ceiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a time sleep was impossible. The buffeting
blows that the big waves struck the laboring
trawler made her shake and creak as if she would
go to pieces at any moment. On deck the heavy
trampling of sea boots kept up without intermission.
The smoky lamp swung drearily. The
motion grew so violent at times that they were
almost pitched out of the bunk. In some corner
into which he had dragged himself, they
could hear the old cook snoring and mumbling
in his sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>But at last, despite all this, tired nature asserted
herself and they dozed off, while outside,
the storm howled and shrieked like a furious
and sentient creature aroused to frenzy and extermination.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>About midnight, Jack awakened with a start
and a vague feeling that all was not well. The
<em>Barley Rig</em> was still tossing violently and for
a few moments after he opened his eyes, the lad
who had slept on the outside of the bunk felt
dazed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he became aware that Captain Hoeseason
was standing near to him, feeling about
under the mattress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s trying to rob us,” thought Jack. “What
shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The thought flashed across him that he had no
weapon, and that Hoeseason was probably
armed. He was undecided whether to feign
sleep or not, for the captain of the <em>Barley Rig</em>
was apparently not yet aware that the boy was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
awake, when he was saved the trouble of making
a decision.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was grasped roughly by the shoulder and
violently shaken. The giant captain, with an
evil look in his eyes, stood above him, a huge
seaman’s knife glimmering in his hand under the
light of the guttering lamp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, younker,” he said, in his hoarse tones,
with a ferocious look, “I ain’t goin’ ter beat
about the bush. I’ve come after that money of
yourn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What money?” demanded Jack, deeming it
wisest to “spar for time,” and see if he could not
devise some way out of the dilemma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, don’t play foxey, Mister Yankee kid,”
snarled the huge fisherman; “you know as well
as I do. The money in that belt I heard you
talking to your chum about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know nothing about it,” declared Jack.
“When I paid you I gave you almost all the
money I had. I am looking to get fresh funds
in Antwerp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
The man tightened his grip on the boy’s shoulder
and fairly yanked him out of the bunk. He
placed his knife between his teeth and compelling
Jack to hold his arms above his head he
searched him. Jack’s heart sank. He knew the
money belt was in the bunk under the pillow.
Beyond doubt this desperate ruffian would search
the sleeping place before very long and discover
its hiding place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So it ain’t on you,” snarled Hoeseason, when
he had finished his search, “but I’ll bet a guinea
it ain’t far away. Stand where you are and don’t
move as you value your life while I overhaul
the bunk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment later an exclamation of savage delight
burst from his bearded lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! Here it is. See, younker, I was bound
to find it and—— What the——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the giant of a man stood half-facing him,
Jack gathered himself for a crouching leap.
He sprang straight at the man’s legs and, catching
him entirely by surprise, brought him to the
floor with a crash that could be heard above the
raging of the storm.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
“Bill! Bill!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a stir in the bunk above.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Help me, quick. He’ll be too much for me
alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What in the world, Jack Ready——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t ask questions. Come, quick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill clambered out of his bunk with alacrity
as soon as he saw what was going forward.
Hoeseason, who had been, luckily for Jack,
slightly stunned by the fall, lay still. In his
fall the knife had flown from his hand and lay
half-way across the cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The knife, Bill,” panted Jack, “the knife before
he comes to. I dare not take chances with
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill quickly fetched the weapon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So he did try to rob us after all,” he said.
“The precious ruffian, I didn’t like his looks
from the start.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind about that now, Bill, but hustle
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
and get some rope. We must tie him, for when
he comes out of this he’ll be a match for the two
of us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There were plenty of odd bits of rope lying
about the cabin on lockers that ran down one
side of it. Bill procured several lengths, and in
a few moments, the semi-conscious giant was
bound hand and foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime, Jack fastened the money belt
round his waist once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish we had pistols,” he said, as they stood
watching the slow return of consciousness to the
bound captain’s face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, this fellow is harmless now,” rejoined
Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but you have forgotten the rest of the
crew, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Scott, I had for a moment. Do you
think they are in league with him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know, but they are bound to find out
his plight sooner or later and we shall have to
reckon with them. We’re in a tight place, Bill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
Captain Hoeseason began to stir. He rolled
his eyes uneasily, and the next moment discovered
that he was tied fast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You young imps,” he roared in stentorian
tones, “cut me loose instantly, or when I do get
free I’ll have such a vengeance on you as
will——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It won’t do you any good to rave like that,
captain,” declared Jack, “and, moreover,
we——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The sentence was never finished. The fabric
of the <em>Barley Rig</em> seemed to heave suddenly upwards
and then rush apart. There was a burst
of blinding flame, and a report that drove the
ear drums in. The next instant, as it seemed to
them, there was an inrush of water on the tide
of which the boys were swept out into the darkness
of the raging seas.</p>

<p class='c009'>The trawler vanished almost as quickly as the
terrific flash of flame from the mine that she had
struck, and which had ended her career for all
time.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br />THE NORTH SEA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The moments that followed were the most
terrible that Jack had ever known in his adventurous
life at sea. Cast adrift in the dark night
and wild sea, he was at first completely bewildered.
The very suddenness with which the
end of the <em>Barley Rig</em> had come had benumbed
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>But ere long, the blind instinct of life asserted
itself. He struck out, hoping to find some wreckage
with which to sustain himself, for in that
rolling, breaking sea, he could not have hoped
to remain afloat long without some support.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wave after wave swept over the bravely battling
lad, half choking him in spite of the fact
that he was an experienced and powerful swimmer.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
“Great Scott!” he thought with dismay. “If
I can’t find some support to cling to before long,
I’m a goner. This is the worst ever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In addition to the difficulty of fighting the
baffling waves, Jack now began to experience a
fresh obstacle to keeping afloat. The weight of
the heavy money belt at his waist seemed to be
drawing him remorselessly down toward the
depths.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first, he had difficulty in accounting for the
leaden feeling that possessed him after being a
short time in the water. But suddenly he recalled
the money belt with its weight of gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll stick it out as long as I can,” resolved
the boy, “and then unfasten the buckle and let
the money sink.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A section of wreckage came within his grasp
at that moment. He made a wild grab for it,
but a great wave swept it beyond his reach. He
began to feel numb and chilled and utterly incapable
of battling for his life much longer.
An odd, reckless feeling of indifference came
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
over him. His movements became automatic,
no longer consciously directed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly he recollected the money belt that
dragged at his body like a leaden weight. He
fumbled with the buckle with one hand while he
trod water. But the strap proved obdurate.
His chilled fingers could not undo it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the end,” murmured the exhausted boy.
“I’m all in, and can’t keep up the fight any
longer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A strange, dreamy sort of feeling crept over
him. He felt the water closing over his head.
Then, suddenly he seemed to be dragged skyward.
His senses swam and he knew nothing
more. When he opened his eyes, it was daylight.
He lay in the bottom of a small boat that
was being tossed about like a chip on the rough
sea which, although it had moderated to some
extent, was still running high.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where on earth am I and what has happened?”
he wondered in the first few seconds of
returning consciousness. “I remember that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
terrible feeling that all was over, that I was drowning
and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank goodness you’re all right again, old
fellow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bill!” cried the young wireless man wildly,
as he recognized the voice, “is that really you or
your ghost? Am I dreaming or drowned?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither, I hope,” rejoined Bill, helping his
chum to raise himself in the bottom of the boat,
“but you came mighty near being the latter if
I hadn’t providentially come within reach of
you just in time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank heaven you did,” replied Jack fervently,
“but tell me, how did it all happen? I
don’t understand. The last I can recollect is
going under and thinking that all was over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which must have been just about the time I
grabbed you by the hair and got you on board
somehow,” continued Bill. “I don’t know how
I did it, but I succeeded.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how did you come to be in the boat?”
Jack wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
“Well, you see when we were both swept out
of that cabin—I guess the trawler must have
been broken in half by the explosion,—when we
were both swept out, I didn’t know what was
happening and just struck out blindly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Same here,” observed Jack. “I was looking
for a bit of wreckage to float on, but none came
my way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know, though I guess I answer that
description,” chuckled Bill, regarding himself
with critical eyes. He was only half dressed,
and the few garments he had on, for it will be
recalled that neither of the boys had had time
to dress, had been almost ripped from him. Nor
was Jack in any better plight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anyhow,” went on Bill, “the first thing I
struck was this boat. It’s the small one that hung
astern of the trawler. The explosion, which
struck about midships, I guess, hadn’t harmed
it and it must have torn loose from its fastenings
when the <em>Barley Rig</em> sank. I clambered into it
and found it was half full of water. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
managed, with an old tin bucket, which luckily,
hadn’t been washed overboard, to bale it to some
extent, and—and then I heard you yell——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t remember crying out,” interrupted
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, anyhow, you gave a good husky yowl
and I glimpsed your head just alongside. I
hauled you aboard and laid you in the bottom of
the boat but I had not the least idea that it was
you that I had the good fortune to rescue till
daylight. You can imagine how glad I was.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what are we going to do now? Have
we oars?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Water?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor food?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we’re not sighted and picked up we’ll be
in a bad fix, old fellow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid so. I guess we’re the sole survivors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
“Yes, poor fellows. One can’t help feeling
sorry even for that rascal Hoeseason.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boat, a small, not over tight ship’s yawl,
swung on the top of a high wave. The boys eagerly
took advantage of this to gaze out over the
crests of the tossing water-mountains.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the heaving, steel-gray sea was vacant of
life. All they could see was a vast expanse of
mighty rollers, desolate and cold under a leaden
sky. They exchanged blank looks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bill, old fellow, we’re up against it,” came
from Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ve known times when things looked
considerably brighter,” admitted Bill dolefully.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br />A NIGHT OF ALARMS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Castaways on the open sea in a boat without
water, food or oars!</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a situation to frighten the bravest. To
add to the peril of the boys’ position, they had
too appalling evidence of the fact that the North
Sea was strewn with floating mines which, even
the impact of a small craft, like the one in which
they were drifting at the mercy of the winds and
waves, would serve to detonate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Small wonder, then, that after a while conversation
grew more and more desultory until at
length they each sat silent, gloomily surveying
their predicament. Fortunately, there was no
hot sun to beat down on them and aggravate the
thirst both were already beginning to feel. But
even with cool weather they could not hope to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
fight off the agonies of thirst for long. Food,
so far, was a secondary consideration.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, too, the frail nature of their craft gave
them cause for anxiety. The gale showed as yet
no signs of breaking up. From time to time the
ragged tops of great waves were ripped off by
the fury of the wind, deluging the boat in spray.
It was necessary to keep bailing constantly if
they hoped to remain afloat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The constant buffeting to which they were subjected
was dizzying and nauseating. Both lads
ached in every limb. In a way they were glad
to have the exercise afforded by bailing, for it
went a long way to keeping their minds employed
and their limbs from stiffening in the
cramped, wet boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet their nerves showed no outward sign of a
breakdown. From time to time they exchanged
sentences intended to be cheerful; but it was a
ghastly sort of merriment of which they soon
tired. Thus the hours wore away and darkness
set in with a slight dimunition of the violence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
the wind and signs, by the clearing of the sky,
that the break of the gale was at hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>But they dared not sleep through the hours of
darkness, except in hasty snatches. Had the
bailing pail been left alone for even an hour,
the boat inevitably would have been swamped.
By midnight, though, the sea was much
smoother. Their dizzied heads, racked by the
incessant tossing, became clearer. They looked
about them. Suddenly Jack gave a shout.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look! Look yonder!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A short distance off, and apparently bearing
down on them, were the red and green sidelights
and the bright white mast-head signal of a
steamer!</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill broke into a shout.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurray, Jack, we’re saved!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so fast, Bill. They may not see us in the
dark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s so. I’d give a million dollars, if I had
it, for a box of matches and some good dry stuff
to burn for a signal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
“Not having those things, there’s no use worrying
about them,” returned Jack quietly, “but
say, Bill, see here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His voice was anxious. He gazed nervously
at the approaching lights.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That steamer’s coming right down on us.
We can see both her sidelights.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, so much the better. She’s bound to see
us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haven’t you thought of another possibility?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of a great danger?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s headed straight for us and we can’t
get out of the way. If she doesn’t change her
course, it will be a miracle if she doesn’t run us
down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hadn’t thought of that,” said Bill in sobered
tones. “What can we do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing but to sit tight and trust to luck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Both lads now sat with anxious eyes fixed on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
the approaching lights. Nearer and nearer they
came, traveling fast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shout, Bill, shout with all your might,” enjoined
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>They began yelling at the top of their lungs.
But those inexorable lights, like the eyes of some
savage monster, still bore down menacingly on
them. Already, in anticipation, they felt the
impact of the sharp bow, the crash of smashed
timbers and the suction of the propellers drawing
them down to death.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They don’t hear us,” said Jack. “If the lookout
doesn’t sight us, we’re lost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The steamer was very close now. By straining
their eyes they thought they could make out
the dark outlines of her hull and spars against
the clearing sky. Bill hid his face in his hands.
He could not bear to look at the Juggernaut of
the seas advancing to crush them. Jack, with
more fortitude, sat erect with a thousand
thoughts whirring through his brain.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mighty bow loomed above the tiny chip
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
of a boat, throwing off a great wave. The comber
caught the light craft and flung it aside.
What seemed like a black cliff, with here and
there a gleaming light piercing its face, raced
past them, and the boat, with two white-faced,
shaken boys in it, was left in the wake of the
fast-moving steamer, safe, but being madly
tossed about by the wash of her propellers. The
danger had passed, almost by a hand’s breadth,
but it was some time before they were sufficiently
masters of themselves to discuss their escape.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br />MEETING AN OLD FRIEND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Morning broke on a comparatively smooth
sea, and two utterly exhausted, sunken-cheeked
lads, weak from exposure and lack of nourishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This thing has got to end one way or another
before long,” declared Bill, his voice coming in
a sort of croak from his parched throat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I’m afraid we can’t stick it out much
longer, Bill,” assented Jack languidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m beginning to see things,” muttered Bill;
“black objects dancing about in the sun. Over
there on the horizon, for instance, I can see a
dark cloud that looks like a tower. I know it
isn’t there, of course, but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Bill, by hookey, it is!” cried Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What, are you going crazy, too?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
“That’s not a tower, but a steamer’s smoke,
Bill,” declared Jack, after prolonged scrutiny.
In a few minutes Bill became convinced that his
chum was right.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But will she pass near enough to see us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a question upon which much, indeed,
their very existence, might depend.</p>

<p class='c009'>On came the cloud of smoke, and now they
could see the funnel and then the hull, of the
steamer that was making it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bill, I—I believe she’ll pass near us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack’s voice trembled and his eyes shone as if
he were a victim of fever. Bill did not answer,
but he clutched the gunwale with hands that
shook, and fixed his gaze on the oncoming vessel.
Neither boy dared to speak, but both of
them felt that if the steamer did not sight them,
it would be more than they could bear.</p>

<p class='c009'>They stood up in the boat when they thought
the craft was near enough to see and waved
frantically, at the risk of upsetting the cranky
little affair.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
“Bill, she’s changing her course,” came from
Jack’s parched and fevered lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe she is. Yes, see there!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Three white puffs of steam burst from the
ship’s whistle. Then came the booming sound
of her siren thrice repeated. The sweetest music
produced by the finest musicians of both hemispheres
could not have sounded as good to the
boys at that moment as did the harsh roar of the
steam whistle that showed them they had been
sighted and that rescue was at hand. From the
steamer’s stern flag-staff fluttered the Dutch ensign,
proclaiming that she was a ship of a neutral
power.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was an additional cause of congratulation
to the boys, for had they been picked up by
a craft flying a belligerent flag, they might have
become involved in fresh difficulties. In half an
hour the steamer, a small freighter, was lying to
not far off the drifting yawl, and a boat had been
lowered and was rapidly pulled toward the castaways.
In a short time they were on board, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
after being refreshed and provided with clothes,
were able to tell their stories to Captain Van
der Hagueen, the stout, red-faced little captain
to whom they owed their safety.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <em>Zuyder Zee</em>, the name of the little
steamer, was bound, to the boys’ great joy, for
Antwerp. She carried salt fish and herrings
from Scotland and scented her entire vicinity
with the aroma of her cargo. But the boys, as
Bill expressed it, would have thought “a limburger
cheese ship a paradise” after all they had
gone through.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning they steamed up the River
Scheldt and came once more in sight of the towers
and spires of the historic city which, it will
be recalled, they had visited some time before
on Jack’s first voyage. Captain Van der Hagueen
told them that after discharging his cargo
he meant to lay up his ship, in which he was part
owner, at Antwerp till the war was over. The
risk of floating mines in the North Sea was too
great to encounter, he declared.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
It was in the earlier days of the war and Antwerp,
a city strongly fortified, had not been
threatened, although every preparation was
being made to receive the enemy if they did
come. Barricades were being thrown up in the
streets and the suburbs, and the thoroughfares
were full of the queerly uniformed Belgian soldiers
the boys had been so much amused at on
their previous visit. Their amusement at Belgian
soldiers had given way, by now, however,
to admiration and respect for the sturdy little
country of fighters that had managed to give a
good account of itself against the most formidable
army ever assembled.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys decided to seek out their good friend
M. La Farge, the Minister of Government Railroads,
who, it will be recalled, they had served
on their first visit, and whose appreciation in the
form of two handsomely engraved and inscribed
gold watches were at that moment in Jack’s
money belt, where he had luckily placed them
for fear of robbery before they embarked on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
<em>Barley Rig</em>. It was fortunate that he had done
so, otherwise it is doubtful if they would have
obtained access to his offices, where they found
him overwhelmed with work. The sight of the
watches, however, proved an “open sesame” to
the Minister’s presence, and the boys—who had
in the meantime provided themselves with new
outfits,—presently found themselves warmly
shaking hands with their old friend who was
unfeignedly glad to see them.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br />THE SKY SLAYER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After the first greetings were over, Jack
plunged into an explanation of their presence
in Belgium in such stormy times. M. La Farge
looked grave, but promised to do what he could
through diplomatic and other sources to locate
Tom Jukes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If, as you say, he has been traveling in state
in a large auto, he ought to be easy to locate,”
he assured them. “I will let you know what I
have been able to discover to-morrow morning.
Every auto entering the country is registered
and its occupants kept track of. Rest assured I
shall do my best for the two young friends to
whom I can never be sufficiently grateful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack thanked him warmly for them both, and
explained that while in London they had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
communicated with the American consuls in Paris
and Berlin, but that nothing had been heard at
either place of Tom Jukes being among the
refugees beseiging the American representatives.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Possibly I shall have better success. At least,
we must hope so,” said M. La Farge. “Much
of the telegraph system is still intact, fortunately.
At least rest on my promise that I will
do all I can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they had already visited the American consulate
in Antwerp, where they had obtained no
news, the two boys found themselves without
anything to do but kill time as best they could
till the next day. As they had spent much of
their time on the Dutch steamer in sleep, they
did not feel like turning in early and so, at Jack’s
suggestion, they visited a theatre. But it was a
gloomy manner of spending the evening, as it
transpired. The inhabitants of Antwerp were
more interested in the bulletin boards announcing
the inroads of the German troops than in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
entertainments. There was an air of anxiety and
depression abroad that could not help but be
contagious, and oppressed by the general atmosphere,
the boys decided before the end of the
performance to return to their hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Jack could not sleep. He lay awake tossing
and turning for an hour or more. In the
street he could hear the regular step and quick
challenge of sentries. Occasionally, far off,
came the sound of bugle calls.</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once he became aware of another
sound. It was one that was strange to him. He
could liken it to nothing but the droning buzz
of a giant bumblebee. It was at first faint;
hardly audible in fact, except to strained ears,
but it rapidly grew in volume, filling the whole
air with the steady vibrating buzz.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sound irritated Jack, sleepless as he was.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It sounds for all the world as if there was a
big buzz saw or a threshing machine at work,”
he mused. “Where on earth does the racket
come from?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
He lay awake listening for a few moments
longer. Then he got out of bed and tiptoed
across the room where Bill lay snoring violently.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lad looked out of the window. The street
and a public square lay far below him. Only a
few lights shone on the thoroughfare. It appeared
deserted but for the sentries marching
up and down unceasingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing there,” said the boy to himself. “I
guess I’ll turn in again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The buzzing sound had grown fainter now.
It was hardly audible in fact. But for some reason
it lingered in Jack’s mind. It was like half
a dozen things he could think of and yet he
could not recall ever having heard that precise
sound before.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last he dozed off, and then sank into a
dream in which it seemed to him that he was
somewhere far out in the country lying under a
shady tree contentedly chewing on a bit of grass
and gazing up through the leafy branches at the
bright sky. But suddenly everything clouded
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
over. The landscape grew dark and sinister,
and the leaves of the tree above him began to
toss and sway in a harsh wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>In his dream, Jack arose and standing up
looked about him. It appeared to him as if he
was gazing down from a height over an immense
battlefield. He could see the dust and
smoke as cannon were wheeled into position and
then the flashes of flame and the belching of fire
from the rifle pits. Men were mowed down like
ripe grain in long windrows.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was horrible but fascinating.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, all at once, came again that strange
buzzing sound. But now it seemed to have in it
a menacing note. It was like a terrible voice.
The boy shuddered as he heard it, harsh and
inexorable, filling the air, which seemed to vibrate
to the steady humming.</p>

<p class='c009'>It grew sharper and louder. Above all, the
noise of the dream cannon and rifles, the boy
could hear it. He awakened with a start, his
heart beating rather wildly.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>
“That was a kind of a nightmare,” he said to
himself. “Glad I woke up. I guess—what’s
that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again that humming sound filled the air as
if a pulsing chord, strung at high tension, had
been twanged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s outside!” exclaimed Jack, for the second
time going to the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s in the air!” he cried an instant later.</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned his face upward. High above the
city, against the stars, he could trace the outline
of a gigantic cigar-shaped body. It was moving
slowly far above him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An airship!” gasped the boy, and then the
next instant:</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Zeppelin!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Something seemed to launch itself from the
dark body of the immense aircraft and streak
downward like a falling star. The next moment,
from a part of the city some distance off,
there was a brilliant flash of flame, and then an
appalling report that shook the earth. But Jack
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
had no eyes for this at the moment. His gaze
was fixed on the Zeppelin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having dealt destruction in one part of the
city it was now making directly toward the
hotel!</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy watched it with a horrible fascination
that held him speechless.</p>

<p class='c009'>The death-dealing craft was destined to pass
directly above the building that sheltered them
and how many others. Craning his neck, Jack
watched its flight above the sleeping city. Dark
as death itself and, with no indication of its
presence but the drone of its engines, the sky
monster moved majestically toward him. It
was then that Jack suddenly found his tongue
as the death in the air approached till it was
almost above his staring eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bill,” he yelled, “Bill, wake up!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook his chum’s shoulder violently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whazzermarrer?” inquired Bill sleepily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get up for your life. Fling on any old
clothes. Let’s get out of here quick.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
“What’s up?” demanded Bill, wide awake
now, and hastily pulling on some clothes, for he
knew Jack would not have aroused him needlessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a Zeppelin, a giant German airship.
She’s blown up a piece some blocks away and
now she’s headed over here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At almost the same instant, a roar of artillery
burst forth. The defenses of Antwerp had awakened
and were concentrating their fire on the
death-dealing monster of the sky. But as the
first reports ripped the silence of the night,
there came another and a mightier report. The
hotel rocked to its foundations. A shower of
plaster and debris crashed into the boys’ room,
half burying them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sky slayer had struck again!</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br />IN THE GLARE OF FLAMES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For a fragment of time,—while a man might
have counted ten,—there was absolute silence
following the shattering report of the bomb.
Then came a babel of cries, shouts and women’s
screams. Hastily throwing on whatever clothes
came first, the two boys rushed out of the
wrecked room.</p>

<p class='c009'>But they did not do this without difficulty,
for a mass of fallen plaster and debris blocked
the door. In the corridor, an electric light still
burned, and the force of the explosion appeared
to have spent itself at the end of the passage
where the boys’ room was situated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wha—what happened?” stammered Bill, as
they gained the corridor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was a bomb, a bomb dropped from a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
Zeppelin,” answered Jack, equally moved. “What
a fiendish bit of business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I only hope they don’t drop any more,” Bill
cried, as they hurried to where the stairway
should have been.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was not there.</p>

<p class='c009'>A great section of it had been blown to kindling
by the force of the explosion. It was at that
moment that Jack became aware of an acrid,
sharp smell very different from the reek of the
lyddite with which the shell had been loaded.
It was a few minutes before he realized what it
was,—fire!</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked behind them. A red glare lighted
up the corridor, and even as he gazed, a sheet
of flame burst from a doorway further down the
passage. Below them, there was bustle and
shouting in plenty, but apparently they were the
only guests quartered in that part of the hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack looked grave. The position they occupied
was a very dangerous one. The gap in the
stairway was wide and they were trapped with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
that chasm in front and the flames behind them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are we going to do?” gasped Bill, turning
pale.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know; we are in a bad fix, Bill,” confessed
Jack. “Perhaps,—hello!” he broke off,
as the tiny figure of a pretty little girl emerged
from a room which adjoined the one they had
just vacated.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tot held in her arms a doll and her eyes
were wide with dismay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, man, what has happened?” she gasped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something very terrible, little girl,” answered
Jack, “but are you alone?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, my mamma’s in the room. She’s sick,
I think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Scott,” groaned Jack, “this is serious.
It was bad enough before, but now——” He
looked at Bill desperately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got to get that woman out of there,”
said Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but how?” cried Jack desperately.
“There’s no way of bridging that gap.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
“I’ve got a plan that might work,” said Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you going to save us?” asked the tot in
a trembling voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear. Don’t be frightened. Stay here
while we bring mamma to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’m scared,” wailed the child, but she
obediently sat down on a chair to await the boys’
return.</p>

<p class='c009'>Inside the room they found a handsome, middle-aged
woman lying half dressed on the floor,
in a faint. Apparently, she had risen and begun
dressing hastily when the first shock of the bomb
came, but the effort had been too much for her,
and she had collapsed. The boys picked her up
as gently as possible and tried to revive her, but
their efforts met with no success.</p>

<p class='c009'>Outside, the glare and roar of the flames were
increasing. There was no time to be lost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s only one thing to do,” said Bill seriously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And that is what? I’m stupid,” confessed
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
“We must make a rope of bed clothes and
lower her and the child down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good. I believe we can get out of this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They hastily tore the clothes of the two beds
in the room and made a long rope of them.
When this had been done, they took a turn of
their “rope” round the marble pillar at the head
of the wrecked staircase. But then came a fresh
difficulty. There was no one on the floor below,
though they shouted to attract attention. Obviously
someone would have to be there to catch
the woman and untie her when she was lowered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You go,” said Jack. “I guess I’m strong
enough to lower you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And leave you here in danger of the flames?”
protested Bill, for it was getting uncomfortably
hot now, and the smoke was blinding.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll be all right, if we hurry,” said Jack. “Go
ahead, Bill, there’s not a minute to be lost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know, but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind any ‘buts’—it’s a matter of life
and death.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>
So Bill reluctantly looped the “rope” under
his arms and then Jack lowered the young engineer
to the next floor. This done, Jack had a
hard task in front of him. He had to fasten the
life-line round the woman and lift her to the
edge of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c009'>This he accomplished by knotting the rope
to the marble pillar, tying it securely at just
such a length as would allow its unconscious burden
to be suspended over the gap in the stairway.
This was accomplished. She was lowered,
and in a short time the woman was received
by Bill, who released her from the line
with all speed. Then came the little girl’s turn.
She was terrified at the idea, but at last Jack,
with the loss of much valuable time, succeeded
in persuading her to make the attempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the delay had made his position terribly
dangerous. The fire was so intensely hot now
that its breath scorched him. The smoke was
so dense, too, that breathing was difficult.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll have a close shave of it,” thought Jack,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
as he glanced behind him and prepared to lower
the little girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>As before, the feat was successfully accomplished,
and then came Jack’s turn. As he slid
nimbly down the rope that had done them such
good service, the flames actually singed his garments.
He was none too soon in reaching the
lower floor, for he had hardly landed when the
fire reached the pillar to which the line was secured
and burned through its fabric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, ‘a miss is as good as a mile,’” said
Jack, “but that’s about as close as I want to come
to being roasted alive.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <br />TWO YOUNG HEROES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The corridor was deserted, but a few lights
burned dimly. No damage appeared to have
been done there, and it was clear that the bomb
had wrought havoc only on the top floor, which
was the one occupied by the boys and those they
had rescued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if the elevator is running?” asked
Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lift was at the upper end of the passage
and they carried the woman to it, but there was
no response to their rings. Outside they could
hear fire apparatus clanging wildly up and the
confused roaring murmur of an immense crowd.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the distance, the guns of the forts boomed,
filling the air with their sonorous thunder as
they fired at the daring night raider of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
enemy. With this sound was mingled the sharper
crackle of light artillery and specially built “sky
guns.” But as they learned afterward, the perpetrator
of destruction on the sleeping city escaped
scot-free, to make subsequent attacks.</p>

<p class='c009'>The elevator apparently not running, they had
to face the task of carrying the unconscious
woman down to the lobby and securing medical
aid. Luckily for their tired muscles, Antwerp
hotels are not like our skyscrapers, and it was
not long before they reached the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>The scene was a wild one. Hysterical women
and white-faced, frightened men, in every stage
of dress or undress, were huddled in the centre
of the place while the hotel clerks and servants
were doing their best to pacify them. In the
confusion, the boys attracted hardly any attention,
and they laid the woman down on a lounge
while they summoned a doctor, of whom several
were already busy attending to women who had
swooned or become hysterical.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fear of the crowd was that another bomb
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
might follow the first. Already word had spread
that a hospital had been struck and a dwelling
house wrecked, two women and a man being
killed outright in their sleep in the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What an outrage!” exclaimed Bill, looking
about him at the wild scene while a doctor administered
restoratives to the woman they had
saved. “To attack women and children and
harmless citizens from the sky.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope they get that old wind bag and blow
it to bits,” wished Jack, with not less warmth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, this is our first taste of war, Jack, and
I can’t say I like it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor I. It would do some of those jingoes
in our own country, who were yelling for war
with Mexico, a lot of good to see this,” returned
the young wireless man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go outside and see what’s going on,”
suggested Bill. “I guess our charge is all right,
now she’s beginning to recover.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If the scene in the hotel had been wild, like a
nightmare more than a reality, that outside was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
pandemonium itself. Imagine a crowd of wild-eyed
men and women, few of them wholly
dressed, surging behind lines of policemen and
the entire street lighted by the ghastly glare
of flames upon which the engines were playing
furious streams.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If that bomb-thrower sailed over here now
he could wipe out half of Antwerp, I should
think,” said Jack, as they elbowed their way
through the throng. Oddly enough, although
the lads had only been able to throw on a few
garments hastily, they did not, till that moment,
recollect that their new outfits had been destroyed.
It was Bill who called attention to this.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We ought to make the fortunes of a tailor,”
he commented. “We’ll have to get a lot of new
stuff to-morrow,—or rather to-day, for it’s after
three o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If this keeps up we’ll be reduced to Adam
and Eve garments before we get through,”
laughed Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>Far in the distance, on the outskirts of the city
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
and on the chain of forts, the white fingers of
the searchlights were sweeping the sky questioningly,
looking for the sky-destroyer to deal out
death to him in his turn. The guns boomed and
cracked incessantly, sending a rain of missiles
upward.</p>

<p class='c009'>But flying high, and favored by a misty sky,
the Zeppelin escaped without injury, leaving a
panic-stricken city in its wake. There was no
more sleep for any one in Antwerp that night.
Vigilance against spies increased ten-fold, and it
was bruited about that the real object of the
aviators had been to blow up the royal palace,
and by destroying the king and queen to terrify
the Belgians into submission.</p>

<p class='c009'>Naturally, sleep was out of the question for
the boys. They spent the rest of the night wandering
about the city and visiting the ruins of
the house that had been struck just before the
hotel. Its entire front was torn out by the force
of the explosion, and just as they arrived, three
bodies had been found in the ruins.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
The sight of the shrouded, still forms brought
home to them with still greater force the horror
of it all.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell you what, Bill,” said Jack, as they returned
to the hotel to breakfast, and found that
the fire had been extinguished and the panic
quieted down, “war is a pretty thing on paper,
and uniforms, and bands, and fluttering flags,
and all that to make a fellow feel martial and
war-like, but it’s little realities like these that
make you feel the world would be a heap better
off without soldiers or sailors whose places could
be taken by a few wise diplomats in black tail
coats. It wouldn’t be so pretty but it would be
a lot more like horse sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gracious, you’re developing into a regular
orator,” laughed Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, the sight of these poor dead folks and
all this useless wreckage got under my skin,”
said Jack, flushing a little, for he was not a boy
much given to “chin music,” as Bill called oratorical
flights.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
During the morning they secured new clothes
for the second time since landing in the city, and
then paid their appointed call on M. La Farge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have good news for you, boys,” he said as
they came into his office. “Your man was last
heard from at Louvain. I suspect he is rather
given to adventure, for I understand that he has
been quite active in aiding our people. It’s
strange that his people have not heard from him,
though.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps they have by this time,” said Jack;
“but if he has been actively siding with the Belgians,
isn’t his neutrality in grave danger, with
all its serious consequences?”</p>

<p class='c009'>M. La Farge nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have heard much of your wealthy young
Americans,” he said, “and while their hearts are
warm and it is good of this young man to be
doing what he can, my advice to you is to get him
to return home as soon as possible—the Germans
shoot first and listen to explanations afterward,
as they say in your country.”</p>

  <h2 id='chXXVII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <br />“THE GERMANS ARE COMING!”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was in the early days of the war when the
gallant defenders of Liege were still undauntedly
holding back the Teuton thousands with
their great “caterpillar” siege guns that were
destined, ere long, to hammer down the stubborn
defense of Belgium’s neutrality. Trains
were running and business, although seriously
hampered, was still being carried on, though the
foe was at the gate and the capital had been removed
from Brussels to Antwerp.</p>

<p class='c009'>Armed with passes signed by M. La Farge,
to which their photographs were attached for
purposes of identification, the boys started for
Liege the next day. It was likely to prove an
arduous and not unhazardous task that they had
embarked upon. In the first place “spy fever”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>
was at its height. Anyone not in uniform was
liable to be held up and questioned, and if satisfactory
explanations were not forthcoming, they
were liable to very unpleasant consequences.</p>

<p class='c009'>The word of any frightened peasant choosing
to “denounce” anybody had led to riots and affrays
in which men and women, suspected of espionage,
had been rescued by troopers after being
half beaten to death.</p>

<p class='c009'>Above all, the boys were warned not to carry
weapons of any kind, an injunction which they
obeyed as they did all the rest of M. La Farge’s
admonitions. The train journey proved exasperating.
Sometimes it would be halted for
hours on a side track while trains, loaded with
young-looking soldiers in a strange medley of
gay Belgian uniforms, went by, the men cheering
and singing. Again, much time was wasted
by careful reconnaissances, for there was fear
that bridges might have been dynamited or the
right of way mined by the spies who were rife
throughout the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
A whole day passed thus, with the train creeping
like a snail and continually stopping and
starting. The roads at the side of the track were
alive with peasants flocking to different centres
from their lonely houses in the country. Some
had their family possessions piled high in small
carts drawn by dogs. Others carried what they
had been able hastily to collect. It was another
sad picture of war and the desolation it had
brought on an inoffensive, industrious little
country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several aeroplanes soared above the train,
reconnoitering the country. At first the boys
were nervous lest there might be a repetition of
the bomb-dropping at Antwerp, but they were
assured by the official on the train, who had examined
their passes, that the aircraft were all
friendly French and Belgian aeroplanes, after
which they watched them with less uncomfortable
feelings. As Bill put it:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we were at war and shouldering rifles for
the dear old U. S. A., we’d take the chances of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>
war with the rest of them, but being a neutral,
there’s no sense in throwing away our bright
young lives,” a sentiment to which Jack agreed
heartily.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was dark when the train rolled into Louvain.
After innumerable challenges by armed
sentries, they at last reached the hotel of the
place where many of the soldiers were quartered.
If Antwerp had seemed like an armed
fortress, signs of military activity were much
more marked in the old cathedral town.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lights were not allowed after eight o’clock.
Citizens were kept off the streets at night after
certain hours. Artillery rumbled through the
city all night, going to the front, the boys were
told.</p>

<p class='c009'>Disquieting rumors of the fall of Liege, and
the advance of the Germans, had already
reached the town, and on the outskirts, barbed
wire defenses were erected and trenches dug
hastily. Residents were warned, in the event
of the Germans entering the city, to behave
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
themselves strictly as non-combatants, the magnificent
cathedral was fitted up as a hospital in
case of emergencies. The thrill of warfare was
in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was early the next morning that Jack
aroused Bill from his sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hark, Bill!” he exclaimed, holding up one
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>From far off came the boom of cannon. The
ground seemed to tremble under the thunder-like
reverberations. Down in the street a squadron
of cavalry raced through the town. Then
came the rumbling of guns being rushed to the
front.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a big battle,” declared Jack; “and what’s
more the sounds have been growing louder. It
must be a retreat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill looked grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In that case we are likely to be in the thick
of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid so, and it may be mighty difficult
to get away. We’ll have to find Tom Jukes as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
soon as we can, and then get back to the coast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>An aeroplane buzzed by overhead, its powerful
engines whirring, buzzing thunderously. By
daylight the town was almost empty of soldiers;
they had all, except a few detachments, been
called to the front during the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>The landlord of the hotel was in a great state
of perturbation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, those terrible Germans!” he exclaimed,
“they will wreck our beautiful town and put us
to death. I know them. Oh, what unhappy
times.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps they may be beaten back,” encouraged
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! No such good fortune,” said the
landlord, wringing his hands miserably. Just
after dawn, a mud-spattered courier arrived, and
declared Liege had fallen, “the Germans are
coming.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Everywhere that was the cry as, after a hasty
breakfast in the disordered hotel, the boys hurried
out.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> <br />FAST TRAVELING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The sound of firing was now much closer.
Frightened faces were peering from behind
shuttered windows. All traffic appeared to have
stopped, and the only life beyond the few persons
abroad, whose curiosity was stronger than
their fear of the big German guns, was when an
occasional body of troops would rush through
the streets.</p>

<p class='c009'>The beautiful Hotel de Ville and the fine old
cathedral, so soon destined to be damaged by fire
and bullets, attracted the attention of the boys
and gained a hearty expression of admiration
from them both. All at once there was a whirr
and the snort of a horn, and an armored war-automobile,
carrying a machine gun, and
painted a business-like gray, dashed around a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
corner and sped on. Another car came close behind
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second machine carried an American
and a Red Cross flag. It was coming fast and
contained two occupants. Both were youths,
and one carried a camera over his shoulder by
a broad strap. But the other attracted Jack’s
notice, for in him he recognized instantly the
lad they were in search of, Tom Jukes, the millionaire’s
son.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hey, Tom Jukes!” he hailed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The car slowed up and the young driver
turned questioningly in his seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, by all that’s wonderful, it’s Jack Ready
and Bill Raynor!” he exclaimed, as the two lads
came up to the car. “What in the world are you
doing here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve been sent to ask you that same question,”
responded Jack, who, it will be recalled,
became well acquainted with Tom Jukes when
the young wireless man was in the hospital in
New York following his battle with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span>
desperate tobacco smugglers he was instrumental in
sending to prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” asked Tom with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, your father hadn’t heard from you
and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hadn’t heard from me! Why, I’ve written
several letters,” declared Tom. “I’d have
cabled, but they’ve stopped all that for the present,
at least. I declare, that’s too bad. And so
the governor sent you on a searching expedition,
eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it was to be a combination of that and
a vacation,” laughed Jack, and he told something
of their adventures on board the “Gold
Ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My word, you fellows are always having adventures,”
said Tom, with a smile on his good-looking
face. “The fact is, I guess reading of
your exploits made me stay over here when this
row started to see if I couldn’t have some of my
own. I’m staying with Belgian friends, about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>
half a mile from here, and so far I haven’t done
much but get ready to help in Red Cross work
and so on. But now I guess it’s up to me to get
back to the U. S. A.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we can,” said Jack. “I don’t know where
the ship we came over on, the <em>St. Mark</em>, has
been sent to. London and Paris are overrun
with American refugees. When we were there,
hundreds of them were unable to get passage,
or even change their money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, the whole world seems to have been
shuffled in this thing,” frowned Tom, “but let
me introduce my friend, Philander Pottle.
He’s a photographer for a New York newspaper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys shook hands with Pottle, a dark
young fellow who talked as explosively as a
machine gun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad to meet you—fine fight—be here soon—great
pictures—snap! bang!—action—that’s the
stuff!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re going out toward the front, that is, if
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span>
we can get by,” declared Tom; “want to come
along?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys looked rather dubious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know what your father——” began
Jack doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tom interrupted him impulsively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, there’s no danger so long as we don’t
get in any of the scrimmages ourselves,” he declared,
“and then the American flag and the Red
Cross emblem will keep us out of trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Both boys were anxious to go, so that it did
not take much more persuasion to make them get
in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now then off we go—bang! biff!—big guns!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Outside the city lay an open country. Far off
they could see a great cloud-like mass of smoke
which, no doubt, marked the place where the
fight was taking place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll make a detour to the north,” declared
Tom. “There’s rising ground there and we can
look down without danger of getting hit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not want to get hit—cannon ball—gee
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
whizz, off goes your head—much better keep it
on,” said Pottle, in his firecracker way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He talks as fast as a photographic shutter
moves,” chuckled Bill to Jack in a low voice and
the other could not but agree. As they rode on,
they passed groups of soldiers and artillery.
Now and then a lumbering wagon, bringing
back wounded men lying on piles of straw, jolted
by, bearing mute testimony of the havoc going
on at the front.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys began to feel sick and queer and
even Tom sobered down at these sights. They
were stopped several times by small skirmishing
bands and made to show their papers, for
a few days before German spies had been captured
in a car flying an American flag. The car
sped up a hill and then started swiftly down on
the other side of the acclivity.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the foot of the hill, a long and steep one,
was a wooden bridge. Tom was driving fast,
when suddenly there was a sharp, snapping
sound and the car leaped forward. Tom’s foot
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
was on the brake in a jiffy, but there was no diminution
in the speed of the machine. Instead, it
appeared to gain momentum every moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bother it all,” muttered Tom; “brakes bust.
I can’t slow down till we get to the bottom of
the hill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope we don’t meet anything,” cried Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we do grand bust—smash—crash—no
chance—wow!” exploded the photographer.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there was nothing in sight, and beyond the
bridge was another up grade where Tom hoped
to gain control of the runaway machine. But
within a few hundred feet of the bridge some
soldiers suddenly appeared, running from the
bridge as if they were in haste to leave the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the car came in sight they waved it frantically
back. One even leveled a rifle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t stop,” shouted Tom Jukes, “brakes
bust.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They flashed by the men who looked mere
blurs at the pace the car was now going.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
Bang! came a shot behind them, but the bullet
whistled by, making them involuntarily
crouch low in the madly racing car. Behind
them came shouts and yells. They could catch
something about Germans.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They think we’re German spies,” gasped
Bill, as the car thundered across the bridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hardly had it flashed across than there came
a terrific explosion and looking back they saw
the whole bridge blown skyward. Their lives
had been saved by a miracle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those soldiers must have mined that bridge
and set the fuse just before we appeared,” declared
Jack, looking rather white and dismayed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We weren’t a second too soon. If we’d been
going slower we’d have been wiped off the map,”
added Bill soberly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to keep running at this speed till
we’re out of this neighborhood,” cried Tom
Jukes. “It’s not healthy.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='chXXIX' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <br />THE UHLANS!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But clearly fate was against their seeing anything
of the battle that morning. They were
still going fast, traveling through a wooded
country that alternated with open stretches,
where they could catch a glimpse of the far-off
fight, when there came a sudden ominous sound:</p>

<p class='c009'>Bang!</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a shot,” cried Bill, looking round
with alarm on his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was no shot,” returned Tom with a rueful
grin, “it was one of the tires blowing out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pop—bang—air all out—pump her up—hard
work—too bad,” exploded Pottle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fritz, I’ll be jiggered if you don’t talk like
a tire going on the fritz yourself,” laughed Tom,
as he succeeded in slowing the car down on a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
gentle grade by reversing the engine and then
stopping at the bottom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fritz—German name—don’t use it in Belgium—think
you’re a spy—then you’ll be on
the fritz,” sputtered Pottle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The car was brought to a standstill opposite a
neat white farmhouse approached by an avenue
of slender dark poplars. A big dog bayed as the
car stopped, but there was no other sign of life
about the place except some chickens pecking
and scratching in the dooryard. In the background
were yellow stacks, for the harvest had
just been gathered. It made a pretty, contented
scene in contrast with the turbulent experiences
through which the boys had passed only recently.</p>

<p class='c009'>But they did not spend much time comparing
the rural peace with the unrest of the cities in
the war area. There was work for them all to
do. First the brake was mended by replacing
a broken bolt that had caused the trouble that
almost ended tragically for them. Then came
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>
the fitting of a new “shoe” and tube, at which
they all helped by turns.</p>

<p class='c009'>The work took some time, and at its completion
they were all dusty, hot, and very thirsty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d give a lot for a good drink of cold water
or milk right now,” puffed Tom, resting from
his exertions with the tire pump. “What do you
say if we go up to that farmhouse and see if we
can buy something to drink?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, for an ice cream soda,” sighed Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You might as well wish for lemonade in the
Sahara desert,” scoffed Tom. “They wouldn’t
know an ice cream soda here if they met it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Laughing and chatting, they approached the
house, walking up the avenue. But as they
neared it, their cheerfulness appeared to receive
a check. No indication of life but those mentioned
appeared about the place. It was silent
and shuttered. The stable seemed to be empty.
No farm wagons stood about.</p>

<p class='c009'>Repeated knockings at the door failed to produce
anyone.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
“There’s a well yonder,” said Tom Jukes.
“What do you say if we help ourselves?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have to, I guess,” agreed Jack.
“Everyone about the place must have been
scared away by the battle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or more probably the men were called to
arms and the women have gone to some place of
safety,” was Bill’s opinion.</p>

<p class='c009'>A great earthenware vessel stood by the well
brink and they refreshed themselves from this
with long draughts of cold, clear water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s better,” declared Tom, as he set down
the pitcher after a second application from it.
“Now let’s be getting on, for we’ve got to find
another road back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait a minute—great chance—deserted
farm—men at war—women flee in haste leaving
faithful dog!” exclaimed Pottle, unslinging his
camera.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, hurry up and get through with your
old picture box,” conceded Tom, “and, by the
way, you might let that dog loose. Poor
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
creature, he’ll surely starve to death tied up like
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Although the dog was a ferocious-looking animal,
he seemed to know that the boys meant to
give him his liberty, for he allowed them to take
off his chain without any opposition and went
to a small stream that flowed behind the house
to slake his thirst.</p>

<p class='c009'>This had hardly been done, and Pottle had
taken a few snaps, when down the road came a
furious galloping and a squadron of Belgian cavalry
appeared, spurring for their lives, while
behind came hoarse shouts and shots.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Scott! We’re in for it now!” exclaimed
Tom in a dismayed voice; “a flanking
party must have attacked those fellows and
driven them back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The squadron, a small one, and probably a
scouting party, galloped past the house without
even noticing the boys and the auto standing in
the road. It was plain they were hard pressed.
They had hardly gone when another body of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
horsemen appeared. They wore gray uniforms.
Their metal helmets were covered with canvas
with the number of their troop stencilled on it
in large figures. Each man carried a lance with
a gleaming point. Like those they pursued they
swept by without paying attention to anything
but the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uhlans!” exclaimed Tom. “I hope we
haven’t blundered into the thick of this thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They all stopped to listen. The noise of the
pursuit had died out, but now more hoof beats
could be heard approaching rapidly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXX' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> <br />“YOU ARE A SPY!”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In another moment a smaller body of men
swept up to the farmhouse, drawing rein at the
sight of the stalled car. By their uniforms and
the fluttering ensign held up by a big trooper,
the boys guessed them to be officers. They
paused for a moment and then, after a few
words, turned and came galloping up the poplar-lined
approach.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys exchanged blank looks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep cool,” urged Tom, “there isn’t anything
they can do to hurt us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know, I’ve heard some queer tales
of the Germans,” declared Jack, rather apprehensively,
“for one thing they’ve no great love
for Americans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they wouldn’t dare to injure us,” declared
Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
The horsemen, of whom there were six, and
they saw that two were slightly wounded, came
galloping up and drew rein. The leader of the
party was a fierce, hawk-nosed old man with an
immense drooping mustache. The others were
young officers, rather foppish-looking. Two of
them wore monocles.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was the figure of the man who brought
up the rear of the party that excited Jack’s attention
to the exclusion of the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Radwig!” he gasped to Bill as he recognized
the figure of the former Herr Professor of the
German War college, in spite of his wearing a
uniform.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wow! There’ll be trouble sure now,” muttered
Bill. “See, he’s looking at us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, he recognizes us and he doesn’t look
over amiable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Radwig spurred his horse to the side of the
hawk-nosed old colonel and spoke rapidly. The
old man bent keen eyes on the party of boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Herr Radwig informs me that two of your
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>
party are spies,” he said in a chilling voice; “is
that the truth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not,” declared Jack, paling a
trifle. “We are all Americans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unfortunately, a great many persons, including
English spies, are protecting themselves
under that banner nowadays,” was the rejoinder.
“I’ll trouble you to show your papers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Mr. Radwig knows me and my friend
here,” burst out Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know nothing but what I suspect,” snarled
Radwig, his eyes gleaming viciously. “Colonel,
will you allow me to search these boys?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The other nodded assent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would rather be searched by somebody
else,” protested Jack, guessing what sort of treatment
they would get from the man who hated
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Herr Radwig will search you,” was the rejoinder,
and then, in German, he gave orders to
a non-commissioned officer,—a sergeant,—to get
a meal ready within the house. Radwig
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span>
compelled the indignant boys to turn out everything
in their pockets and Pottle’s camera was
ordered destroyed forthwith.</p>

<p class='c009'>Radwig’s search was rapid and thorough.
When it was concluded, he turned to the colonel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is nothing incriminating on any of
them, but on this one here,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c009'>He pointed at Jack as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And he——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has two passes on the Belgian railroads in
his pocket.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was true, for Jack had not given up both
passes the last time they had to show them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That seems to prove that he has some position
of trust with the Belgian government,” declared
Radwig, “and as such is properly a prisoner
of war.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack looked his dismay; but the colonel gave
a sharp order. Two soldiers laid hold of the
boy. He started to shake them off indignantly
while his friends looked on aghast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can explain all this,” he cried; “this man
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
Radwig had trouble with me. He’s trying to
get even. He——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take him away,” came the cold order in unmoved
tones. “You are responsible for him,”
added the colonel to Jack’s two captors. “See
that he is carefully guarded till the court martial.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The court martial!” cried Jack. “Why, I—I’m
an American citizen and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no more to be said,” and Jack, with
an armed guard pressing a revolver to either
side, was marched off without a chance to say
more. As he went on, he could hear his friends
protesting indignantly and then, they too, were
taken in charge by the soldiers and escorted to
the automobile. Then came a sharp order to
them to drive back to Louvain on pain of
death. There was nothing for them to do but to
obey. The iron discipline of the German officers
allowed no argument. And so, leaving Jack
to his fate, they were compelled to drive off with
heavy hearts.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
“Don’t worry, we’ll get the American consul
and get him out all right,” said Tom, as cheerfully
as he could.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Bill, with the thought of a court martial
in his mind, sat in a miserable state all the way
back to the town which they reached only after
making a long detour, necessitated by the
blown-up bridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>His chum in the hands of the Germans, and
subject to court martial, Bill had good cause to
feel worried and oppressed as to the outcome
when he realized the influence that Radwig,
Jack’s enemy, appeared to possess. To what
terrible lengths might not his desire for vengeance
lead him?</p>

  <h2 id='chXXXI' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br /> <br />COURT-MARTIALED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Poor Jack, with feelings that may be imagined,
was roughly thrust into a smoke house and
the door slammed. Outside the sentries paced
up and down ceaselessly, showing him that to
think of escaping would be useless. There he
must stay at the mercy of Radwig till his fate
was decided.</p>

<p class='c009'>No wonder, as he sank on a rough stool, he
felt for a moment sick and apprehensive. The
glitter in Radwig’s eyes when he saw who it was
he had made prisoner had warned Jack to expect
severe treatment. The hours dragged by
and no one came near him. It was pitch dark
in the smoke house, which, of course, had no
openings and hardly any ventilation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The clank of the sentries’ sabres, and their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
steady, monotonous tread, were the only sounds
that disturbed the stillness except for an occasional,
far-off rumble of cannonading. Evidently
the main tide of the battle had rolled back
from the scene of the morning’s engagement. If
it had not been for the presence of the sentries,
which showed that he was not forgotten, Jack
would have been inclined to think that his captors
had ridden on and left him.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the steady tramp-tramp outside precluded
all possibility of this. At last the door
was flung open, and the two men guarding him
entered the dark smoke house. Jack saw then
that it was late twilight, but a cloudy sunset,
threatening a coming storm, made it appear
later.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come,” ordered one of the impassive, gray-uniformed
Germans, who seemingly possessed
a knowledge of a little English.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no resource but to obey. Jack,
with a beating heart, fell in between his two
guardians.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic005'>
<a href='images/i4f.jpg'><img src='images/i4.jpg' alt='' class='ig005' /></a>
<p>“You have heard yourself accused of being a spy,” began the Colonel harshly.—<i>Page</i> <a href='#Page_229'>229</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
“I’ve got to be cool and keep my head,” he
told himself as he was marched toward the
house. “Any false step now might be fatal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Within the farmhouse, kitchen lights had been
kindled. Two yellow flaring lamps showed the
group of officers about the table with their
swords laid among the remains of a meal. Wine
spilled on the cloth and empty glasses showed
that the farmhouse cellar had been raided for
their entertainment.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the head of the table sat the hawk-nosed
colonel. Next him was Radwig. One of the
officers, a major, was tilted back in his chair
snoring noisily. Jack’s heart sank. He saw no
signs of a fair trial.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have heard yourself accused of being a
spy,” began the colonel harshly. “What have
you to say to the charge?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Simply that it’s ridiculous. If you will give
me time my friends will be back here with
ample proof that I am an American citizen, a
wireless operator and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
“Ah, ha!” exclaimed the colonel, placing one
finger to the side of his hawk-like beak and
looking cunning. “So that is it. A wireless
operator with Belgian passes in his possession.
It looks bad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Radwig bent over and whispered something
in the colonel’s ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Herr Radwig tells me that you are a hater
of Germans. That you had him placed in custody
in England and that he only escaped to
join our army after surmounting great difficulties.
What have you to say to that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As to being a hater of Germans, no American
is that,” said Jack. “We are all neutral in
this struggle. So far as Herr Radwig being imprisoned
in England, he was already in irons on
the ship before she docked.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that true?” demanded the colonel of Radwig,
who smiled and waved his hand with a gesture
that signified “absurd.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see Herr Radwig denies that you tell
the truth,” remarked the colonel.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
“Surely my word is as good as his,” protested
Jack, trying to keep cool, although he saw
that things looked black indeed for him before
such a prejudiced tribunal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Herr Radwig is a German we all know and
honor,” retorted the colonel. “Who you are we
do not know. Therefore, between you, we must
believe him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t mean that you believe I am a spy?”
blurted out Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The evidence shows it,” rejoined the colonel
coldly. “You are aware of the rules of war?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole room suddenly swam before Jack’s
eyes. A deadly chill passed through him. For
an instant he could not assure himself that it
was not a hideous dream from which he must
soon awaken. But the next instant, the reality,
the horrible fact that he was about to be sentenced
to death as a spy, rushed back upon him.
He tried to speak but his dry lips refused to deliver
a word.</p>

<p class='c009'>The colonel and Radwig whispered, and then
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_232' id='Page_232'>232</a></span>
the former announced in his harsh grating voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be at reveille to-morrow. Remove
the prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you don’t understand,” he choked out,
“surely you don’t mean to execute me, an American
citizen, without a chance to explain.
I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will assume full responsibility,” was the
cold reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack struggled with his captors, but a cruel
blow in the small of the back with the butt of
a rifle so dizzied him, that by the time he recovered
his senses, he was back in the dark, foul-smelling
smoke house once more.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXXII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br /> <br />THE LONG NIGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Then followed the blackest hours of Jack’s
life. Outside the sentries kept up their eternal
pacing. In the distance a dog barked, and there
was still scattered firing. For a long time the
unfortunate young wireless man sat huddled on
the floor of his prison in a sort of torpor.</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once he recollected that one of his
guards spoke English. Perhaps he could get the
loan of pen or pencil and paper to write some
last words. But when hammering at the door
for some moments brought a response, his request
was gruffly refused. The sentry resumed
his measured pacing.</p>

<p class='c009'>One—two! One—two! Hour after hour the
sound beat into Jack’s brain till he thought his
head would burst.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
Then came another sound.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sound of digging! The blows of a mattock!</p>

<p class='c009'>A cold perspiration broke out on Jack’s forehead
as he realized the import of this. They
were digging his grave, and by a refinement of
cruelty, within earshot of his prison place.
Whether by accident or design, poor Jack was
being forced to hearken to the most grisly of
the preparations for the next morning’s reveille.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the hours crept by leaden-footed. Sleep
was out of the question as much as was possibility
of escape. The sound of the digging, which
Jack had stopped his ears to keep out, had
ceased.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came a sudden stir outside. The sound
of hurrying feet and commands barked in sharp,
quick voices. Jack’s heart gave a bound.</p>

<p class='c009'>Could it be a detachment of Belgians summoned
by Tom and Bill coming to wipe out the
small force occupying the farm?</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>
He flung himself against the door of the
smoke house, listening intently. There was a
tiny crack at one of the posts and through this
he could command a limited view of the moonlit
farmyard. Then came an odd sound. Like
the dry whirring of insects in the fall. It grew
in volume. The hurrying and the shouts increased,
too. Shots were heard, scattering one
after the other and a yell that sounded like a
shout of warning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the world rocked and spurted flame.
Screams and groans filled the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again there came an explosion that shattered
the night and sickened the senses. Jack, half
stunned, fell to the floor of the smoke house as
part of its roof was torn off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came silence, broken an instant afterward
by groans and moans and swift, alarmed
orders. There was a rat-a-plan of hoofs. The
queer whirring sound died out. Only the moans
still continued. Dizzy and sick, Jack got to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>236</a></span>
As yet he could not quite realize what had
happened. Suddenly followed realization.</p>

<p class='c009'>A night raiding aircraft had spied the shifting
lights of the encampment and, by the moonlight,
caught the gleam of stacked arms, and had
struck.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sound of the sentries’ ceaseless pacing had
stopped. Jack shouted and pounded on the door
of the partially wrecked smoke house, but there
was no answer but the moans and cries that were
now getting fainter and less frequent. The sides
of the smoke house were of rough logs and without
much difficulty Jack clambered to the shattered
roof.</p>

<p class='c009'>He raised himself and clambering over, gave
a hasty glance about him. It was a terrible scene
of wreckage that he surveyed. In the earth two
immense holes, big enough to bury two horses,
had been torn, and close by lay two men. Over
toward the house was a third figure stretched
out. Three horses, one of which died as Jack
was looking over the carnage, lay not far off.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span>
There was nobody else in sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack clambered over the edge of the gap the
shell had torn in the roof and dropped lightly to
the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wasser!” moaned one of the wounded men,
whom Jack recognized as one of his guards.
The boy sped to the well and hastened back with
the big earthen pitcher from which they had
refreshed themselves earlier that day.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he was too late. Even as the boy held the
cooling draught to the sentry’s lips, the man
died. The other was already dead when the
boy dropped to the ground, his body frightfully
shattered by the aerial bomb.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was still the third man lying by the
house and Jack, thinking he might be able to
minister to him, hurried over. But here, too, the
bomb had struck fatally.</p>

<p class='c009'>A shaft of moonlight fell through the poplars
and illumined the man’s face. It was Radwig,
struck down in death even as he had planned a
cruel revenge for another. Jack covered the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_238' id='Page_238'>238</a></span>
dead professor’s face with the man’s huge blue
cloak and then stood silent for a moment. The
rapidity with which it had all happened almost
stunned him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fifteen minutes before he had been a prisoner
with the hideous sounds of spade and mattock in
his ears. Now he was, by nothing short of a
miracle, free again. He raised his face to the
sky and his lips moved silently. Then, with a
last look about the place, he prepared to leave,
fervently hoping that before another day had
passed he would be with his friends once more
in Louvain.</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once he heard a loud whinny. One of
the dead troopers’ horses had been left behind in
the mad flight from the farmhouse. It was saddled
and bridled, although the girth had been
loosened. Jack untied it, tightened the girths,
and mounted. He did not know much about riding,
but somehow he managed to stick to the
animal’s back as he directed it down the road.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every now and then he drew rein and listened.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>239</a></span>
He had no desire to encounter prowling bands
of Uhlans or to run into the small force that had
evacuated the farmhouse, no doubt believing
him to be dead. But dawn broke while he was
still traveling, not at all certain that he was going
in the right direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack decided to abandon his mount. Taking
off its bridle so that it could find forage along
the roadside, he patted its neck and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks for the ride, old fellow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then bareheaded, and tired almost to exhaustion
by all he had gone through, yet driven
on by dire necessity of reaching the Belgian
lines, the lad struck off across a wheat field into
a path of woodland. On the edge of the field he
shrank suddenly back into the tall wheat. There
lay a man’s coat, a stone jug and a basket. No
doubt the man was close at hand. But although
he crouched there for a long time, nobody came,
nor was there any sound of human life. Birds
twittered and once a rabbit cocked an inquisitive
eye at the lad as he lay crouched in the wheat.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
Cautiously Jack raised himself and parting
the stalks, peered out. He saw something he had
not noticed before. The man, who doubtless
owned the belongings which had alarmed Jack,
lay stretched out at the foot of a tree. He was
on his face sleeping.</p>

<p class='c009'>But was he sleeping?</p>

<p class='c009'>An ugly, dark stain discolored the ground
around him. His shirt was dyed crimson. Jack
saw, with a shudder, that he had nothing to fear
here. The poor peasant was dead. Shot down
by wandering Uhlans no doubt, as he was about
to gather his harvest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor fellow, he’ll never need these now,”
said Jack, as driven by thirst and hunger he investigated
the stone jug and the basket. One
held cider, the other the man’s dinner of black
bread, onions and coarse bacon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Too famished to mind the idea of eating the
dead man’s dinner, Jack stuffed his pockets, took
a long pull of the cider jug and then plunged
into the wood. Here he flung himself down to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
rest and eat. Then, tired as he was, he forced
himself to rise and travel on again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Faint and far off the distant rumble of cannonading
came to his ears, but here in the woods
it was as calm and peaceful as if war, death and
slaughter were forgotten things. At length he
came to a place where the woods thinned out
and there was a small clearing. He was about to
advance across this when he saw something that
caused his heart to give a quick leap and stopped
him short in his tracks.</p>

<p class='c009'>At one side of the clearing was an aeroplane!</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a big monoplane with gauzy, yellow
wings and a body painted the color of the sky on
a gray day, no doubt to make it invisible at any
considerable height.</p>

<p class='c009'>Any doubt that it was a war machine was removed
by the sight of a small but wicked-looking
rapid-fire gun that was mounted on its forward
part.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack was still looking at it, rooted to the spot
as if he had been a figure of stone, when there
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
was a sudden crackle on the floor of the wood behind
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came an order sharp and crisp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Arrette!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack was not a French scholar but there was
something in the way the command was given
that made him stand without moving a muscle.
Footsteps came behind him and then he felt
rather than saw a man passing from the rear to
face him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He worked round to the front of the boy and
then Jack saw that he was a small man with
carefully waxed mustache in whose hand was a
particularly serviceable-looking revolver, which
he held unpleasantly level at Jack’s head.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXXIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br /> <br />THROUGH BULLET-RACKED AIR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The man with the revolver gave a sudden cry:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Mon ami</em> Read-ee!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Scott, de Garros!” gasped Jack, recognizing
the French aviator. “What are you doing
here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I might ask zee same question of you,”
smiled the other. “I leave you on zee sheep and
now, voila! I find you in a Belgian wood wizout
zee hat, wiz your face scratched by zee
bramble and looking—pardon me, please,—like
zee tramp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess I do,” laughed Jack, in his relief at
finding that instead of falling again into the
enemy’s hands, he had met an old friend; “but
I’m lucky that there’s nobody to say ‘how natural
he looks’——”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span>
“Pardon, I don’t understand,” said de Garros
in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack plunged into a recital of his adventures,
interrupted frequently by a hail of “<em>Sacres</em>,”
“<em>Nom d’un noms</em>,” and “<em>Chiens</em>,” from the
Frenchman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now it’s up to you to explain how I find
you here in the heart of a Belgian wood with a
war machine,” said Jack as he concluded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Zat is eezee to explain,” said the Frenchman.
“After you leave me in New York I get passage
on a French liner for Havre. We arrive and I
am at once placed in command of zee air forces
of Belgium. Since zat time, pardon my conceit,
monsieur, I think zat wizout bragging I can say
I ’ave cause zee Germans very much trouble.
Last night I fly over zee country and where I see
Germans I drop a little souvenir,—but what is
zee matter, monsieur, you look excited.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, go on,” said Jack; “I was just thinking
that it’s possible the day of miracles has come
back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_245' id='Page_245'>245</a></span>
De Garros stared at him but went on:</p>

<p class='c009'>“In zee course of my journey I see a farmhouse
where Gerrman cavalry horses and
stacked arms show in zee moonlight,” said the
Frenchman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you know they were Germans?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you not know all zis territory is now
overrun by zem? Yesterday they advance.
They are now near Louvain. But nevaire fear,
someway we drive zem back. But to continue.
I drop one, two bomb wiz my compliments
and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saved my life!” exploded Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>De Garros looked concerned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Once more pardon, my dear Readee, but you
are well in zee head? Zee sun——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, don’t you see?” cried Jack; “those
were your bombs that resulted in my being
saved from a spy’s death.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Sacre!</em> Ees zat possible? And yet it must
’ave been so! Embrace me, my dear Readee,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>
nuzzing I ’ave done ’ave give me so much plaisair
as zees.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack had to submit to being hugged by the enthusiastic
little aviator to whom, as may be expected,
he felt the deepest gratitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now what are zee plan?” asked de Garros,
when his enthusiasm had subsided.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to join my friends in Louvain,” said
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Nom d’un chien!</em> You are trying to walk
zere through zees part of zee country!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, yes. I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Mon ami</em>, you might as well commit zee suicide.
It is swarm wiz German. I hide in zees
wood till night when I can travel wizout having
zee bullet swarm like zee bee round what you
call zee bonnet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then what am I going to do?” he demanded.
“I can’t stay here and I’ve had one experience
with the Germans, and I assure you it was quite
sufficient to last me for a lifetime.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ’ave zee plan,” said de Garros.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My aeroplane hold three people.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall fly wiz me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To Louvain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If that is possible. If not, to some place
where you can communicate wiz your friend.
’Ow you like zat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack hesitated a moment. He was not a timid
lad, nor did he fear ordinary danger. Yet flying
above the German troops, between the place
where they were talking and Louvain, was a
risky business to say the least of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet there was no alternative that he could perceive.
The mere idea of getting captured by
Uhlans again gave him goose flesh. As if he
read his thoughts de Garros said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You run no more of zee reesk in zee flight
than you do on zee ground. Not so much. At
night I fly high and I promise you I will not
make any attacks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re on,” said Jack, extending his hand.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXXIV' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br /> <br />A FLIGHT OF TERROR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Take zees. You need zem. We fly fast.
<em>Très vite.</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>De Garros was speaking as he handed Jack a
pair of goggles. It was dusk and they, having
finished an excellent meal from the aviator’s
provision pannier, were about to start on their
flight across the war-smitten country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Already the flying man, aided to the best of
Jack’s ability, had gone over the aircraft, testing
every part of it. Everything was in perfect
order, from the big Gnome eight-cylindered,
self-contained motor, mounted with the big
propeller forward, to the last bolt on the dragonfly
tail.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just before full darkness fell, which might
have involved them in an accident in rising, de
Garros gave the word to get on board. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_249' id='Page_249'>249</a></span>
clambered aboard, Jack with a heart that beat
and nerves that throbbed rather more than was
comfortable.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are few people who do not feel a trifle
“queer” before their first flight above the earth,
and in Jack’s case the conditions of danger were
multiplied a hundred-fold, for before they had
cleared the woods and risen to a safe height they
might be the target for German rifles and quick
firers. De Garros wore a metal helmet padded
inside. Jack had to be content with an old cap
that happened to be in the aeroplane, left there
by some machinist.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, as de Garros said, the metal helmet
would not be much protection against the projectile
of a quick firer, or even a rifle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fighting aircraft was fitted with a self-starter,
obviating the necessity of swinging the
great propeller.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All ready?” asked the Frenchman of Jack,
who sat behind him, tandem wise, in the long,
narrow body of the machine.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_250' id='Page_250'>250</a></span>
“Ready,” said Jack, in the steadiest voice just
then at his command.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then up ve go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The self-starter purred, and then came the
roar and a crackle of the exhausts as the propeller
swung swiftly till it was a blur. Blue
smoke from the castor-oil lubricant spouted,
mingled with flame, into the thickening air of
the evening. The wholesome smell of the wood
was drowned in the reek of gasoline and oil
fumes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gracious, if there are any Germans within a
mile, they’ll hear this racket,” thought Jack,
with a gulp. “It sounds like a battery of gatling
guns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>De Garros took his foot from the brake lever
and the machine darted forward. Jack clutched
the sides desperately till his knuckles showed
white through the skin. Then he gave a shout
of alarm.</p>

<p class='c009'>The machine had suddenly reared up like a
startled horse. The jolting and bumping of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_251' id='Page_251'>251</a></span>
“take-off” stopped. The boy realized with a
thrill that they were flying.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that instant from the trees on one side of
the clearing burst several Uhlans.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Germans!” cried Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maledictions!” exclaimed the Frenchman.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a second or two the Uhlans stood paralyzed
as the machine shot upward. They had
heard the staccato rattle of the engine from
where they lay camped, not far off in the same
woods that had sheltered de Garros and Jack.
Thinking it betokened a skirmish, they had hastily
run toward the noise just in time to see the
wasp-like machine whirr its way skyward.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the machine was not well above the trees
when they recovered from their surprise. Rifles
were leveled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look out!” cried Jack, “they are going to fire
on us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold tight now, I show you zee trick,” rejoined
the flying man quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The aeroplane was now above the wood which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_252' id='Page_252'>252</a></span>
on that side was a mere belt of tall trees. Suddenly
the machine ceased its upward flight. It
rocketed downward like a stone. Above it bullets
whistled harmlessly as the Uhlans fired at
the place where it had been and was not.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ground rushed up to meet them as the
machine plummeted downward. Jack’s head
swam dizzily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll be killed sure!” he thought, but
strangely enough, without much emotion, except
a dull feeling that the end was at hand.
Then just as disaster seemed inevitable, the machine
suddenly began to soar again as Jack could
have sworn it grazed the tall grass.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up and up they shot, in a long series of circles,
and then de Garros turned and grinned at
Jack, showing his white teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Ow you like?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I guess. I’ll tell you after a while” rejoined
Jack, with suspended judgment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The earth lay far below them now, although
it was still light enough to see the fields marked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_253' id='Page_253'>253</a></span>
off like the squares on a chess board and the
countless fires of the Germans that dotted the
landscape almost as far as could be seen. At
every one of them were men, who, if any accident
befell the machine and it had to descend,
would make things very interesting for the air
travelers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack could not help thinking of this as the
aeroplane flew steadily along, her motor buzzing
with an even sound that told all was going
well. But he knew they were not out of danger
yet.</p>

<p class='c009'>A hundred things might befall before they
arrived safely in Louvain.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>254</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXXV' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br /> <br />THE BULLY OF THE CLOUDS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And then all at once the danger came.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ahead of them loomed, in the darkness, for
the moon had not yet risen, a bulking dark form.</p>

<p class='c009'>An exclamation burst from the Frenchman’s
lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Zeppelin. Malediction!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think she’ll attack us?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. I can’t tell yet which way
she is coming. Ah!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A long ray of light, like a radiant scimitar,
glowed suddenly from the mighty aircraft, 400
feet long and capable of carrying many men and
tons of explosives.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hither and thither the ray was flung.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Zey heard our engines. Zey look for us!” exclaimed
de Garros.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>255</a></span>
He shot up to a greater height. He was manœuvering
to get above the Zeppelin, where her
guns would be useless against the aeroplane,
which was more mobile and swifter in the air
than the Kaiser’s immense sky-ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>But suddenly the glowing light enveloped
them in its full blaze. Dazzlingly it showed
them in its rays. It was the most peculiar sensation
Jack had ever experienced. It was like
being stood up against a wall with a fiery sabre
pressed to your breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a quick movement of the wheel, de Garros
sent the aeroplane out of range of the revealing
light. The next moment came a sharp
crackle and something screamed through the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Missed!” exclaimed the aviator with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the questioning finger pointed its interrogating
tip hither and yon across the night sky.
Others from below now joined it in its quest.</p>

<p class='c009'>The firing from above, and the sight of the
searchlight had been rightly guessed by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>256</a></span>
Germans encamped below. They knew that a hostile
aircraft was above them and were helping
in the search for it.</p>

<p class='c009'>A sharp exclamation broke from the Frenchman.
He bent and fumbled with some contrivance
on the floor of the aeroplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a sharp click.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What have you done?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have released zee bomb.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The dickens!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Watch! Now you see!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fascinated, even in the midst of the awful
danger they were facing high above the earth
in the upper air, Jack leaned over and stared at
a battery of searchlights sending out fan-shaped
rays on every side.</p>

<p class='c009'>He guessed this was the objective of de Garros’
bombs. He was right.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he gazed there was what looked like the
sudden opening of a flaming fire below, and the
searchlights went out as if a giant had snuffed
a monstrous candle.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>257</a></span>
Then came the report, booming upward
through the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aha! Zere are some Germans below zere
who will not do zee mischief more!” exclaimed
the Frenchman with vicious satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>But his congratulations to himself were premature.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the light of the Zeppelin enveloped
them. The glare seemed like a warm bath of
all-revealing light. There was a flash and then
the shriek of a projectile as the aeroplane
dipped under the glow of the light. Then came
the boom of the report.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Zey ought to learn to shoot,” muttered de
Garros.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank heaven they can do no better than they
are,” rejoined Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we show zem zee clean pair of heels
and run away,” said de Garros.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad to hear that. I couldn’t stand much
more of this,” thought Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I was alone, or had an officer wiz me, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>258</a></span>
go above zat Zeppelin high in zee air and blow
him up,” announced de Garros cheerfully, after
a minute or two. “Ah! zey get us again.
<em>Peste!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>The whine of a machine gun sounded as the
searchlight of the pursuing Zeppelin again enveloped
the bold little aeroplane. Her great
bulk, big as a steamship, was rushed at top speed
through the air. They could catch the roar of
her four motors being driven at top speed.</p>

<p class='c009'>De Garros had dropped again, and thanks to
his skill, the aeroplane was still unhit, although
the projectiles from the quick firer had come
close enough for the occupants of the monoplane
to hear their whine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We beat zem out!” exclaimed the Frenchman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we are faster than they are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, very much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we can’t be too fast for me,” muttered
Jack. “I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Sacre!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>259</a></span>
The searchlight had again caught them, and
again there had come reports from her underbody.
This time the sharp crackle of rifles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you hurt?” cried Jack, as the Frenchman
gave a sharp exclamation recorded above.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Malediction, yes. Zey nick my hand. Eet is
not bad. But worse zey hit zee motor I think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The smooth-running machine was no longer
firing regularly. Its speed had decreased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you going to do now?” cried Jack.
“We’ll be mowed down by those machine guns
if we slow up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must come down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the Germans?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are no campfires below us now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But can you make a good landing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Parbleu!</em> If I cannot zen all our troubles are
over, <em>mon ami</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The aeroplane began to descend, slowly at
first and then faster. The dark earth sky-rocketed
up at them from below.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>260</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXXVI' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br /> <br />A MYSTERIOUS CAPTURE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But the disaster de Garros had feared more
than admitted did not happen. Between two
patches of wood lay an open field, readily distinguished
even in the dark by its lighter color.
In the stubble of a mown crop the aeroplane
alighted, not without a considerable jolt to its
occupants.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their main anxiety now was the great Zeppelin
they could hear, but not see, above them.
Jack trusted they were equally invisible and that
the searchlight would not reveal them, for high
explosive bombs in a deadly rain from above
would certainly follow.</p>

<p class='c009'>De Garros, while wringing his wounded hand
with pain, was helped out of the machine by
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_261' id='Page_261'>261</a></span>
“Malediction, and I not get zee chance to fire
on zat <em>chien</em> of a Zeppelin,” lamented the
Frenchman. “Some day I pay zem back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is your hand badly hurt?” asked Jack
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know and we dare not yet use zee
electric torch I ’ave on zee machine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would show zee Zeppelin where we
’ide.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you don’t think they guess that we have
descended?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, if they had zey would search zee ground
wiz zeir light.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But now they are point eet ’ere, zere, all
over zee sky. If zey no find us zey think zat we
are keel and zey go away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack shuddered at the narrow escape they had
from this being made literally true.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a long time, or so it seemed to the anxious
watchers below, the Zeppelin soared above
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>262</a></span>
them, her searchlight swinging in every direction.
But at last the noise of her engines grew
dimmer and the light vanished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Zey go away disgoost,” said de Garros,
shrugging his shoulders. “Now we see what are
zee chances of patching up my hand and getting
zee engine going again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The electric light, carried to locate engine
trouble at night, was switched on and brought
out by its long wires over the side of the craft.
Then began an anxious examination of the aviator’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>It proved that the tip of his thumb, where it
had laid on the edge of the wheel, had been
badly nicked by a bullet, but luckily it was the
left member.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If zee engine ees capable of being fixed I
can drive wiz my right hand,” declared the aviator.
“Thank the <em>bon Dieu</em> that it was not zee
steering wheel zat was struck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With the first aid kit, carried by all soldiers
in the field, they soon dressed and bound the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>263</a></span>
injured member, and then came the examination
of the engine, an investigation on which much
depended. If it proved to have been too badly
damaged to be repaired, they would not stand
much chance for escape in a country so overrun
with German troops. For all they knew some
might be camped not far off. But they had to
take their chance of that.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Ciel</em>, we are in zee luck!” exclaimed de Garros,
after a brief examination, “the <em>chiens</em> only
smashed a spark plug. I soon fix ’im and zen
once more we start.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The repair kit contained the necessary plug,
which he quickly replaced. Then the journey
through the night, which had already proved so
eventful, was renewed. But now Jack felt a
fresh alarm. How would they be able to tell at
Louvain that it was a French and not a German
aeroplane hovering above them.</p>

<p class='c009'>He put the question to de Garros.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Zat is easy. I ’ave on zee side of zee machine
a set of four electric lights. Two are red,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_264' id='Page_264'>264</a></span>
one is green, one is white. Zat is zee secret night
signal of zee French machines.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But suppose the Germans should find out
your code?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eet is changed every night. Sometimes two
green, one white, one red—many combinations
are possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By Jove, I never thought of that!” exclaimed
Jack, struck by the simplicity of the idea, and relieved
at the thought that there would be no danger
of being attacked by mistake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Half an hour later they landed at a sort of
fair ground in Louvain after answering all challenges
satisfactorily. The Germans were not yet
at the gate of the city. But they were near at
hand and the place was wrapped in darkness.
However, on account of de Garros’ rank, they
obtained an escort to the hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tired from the excitement and nervous strain,
Jack went to bed, sighing with relief at the
thought that all was so promising.</p>

<p class='c009'>In about an hour or so he awakened from a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_265' id='Page_265'>265</a></span>
deep sleep. The night was sultry, and there was
a strange calmness in the atmosphere seemingly
weighed with grave and impending events.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack could not resist an impulse to leave his
room and wander out into the deserted streets
of Louvain.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had not taken a dozen steps when a heavy
hand fell on his shoulder. Before he could turn
to see his assailant, he was whisked from the
ground and swept onward to a great height.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still dead silence reigned.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>266</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXXVII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br /> <br />THE MIGHT OF MILITARISM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was some time later that Jack began to
realize that he was a prisoner and borne on a
giant aeroplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>How did he get there?</p>

<p class='c009'>Try as he would he could not answer that
question. He gazed about him. Away in the
distance he could distinguish small specks of
light, which, were they not moving so rapidly
about space, he would have mistaken for stars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Below searchlights swept the horizon. Here
and there were the glimmerings of fast dying
out camp-fires. Suddenly a faint streamer of
red light shot high into the air, held steadily
for a moment, and then broke into a million
colored globules.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>267</a></span>
“A signal,” thought Jack. “I wonder if it will
be answered.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He then became aware of a movement on the
part of the air pilot. Till that moment he had
not noticed the least sign of life from the wheel
man. Now there came a soft <em>blob</em> and a red
light shot into the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost instantly there again was darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By Jove!” whispered Jack to himself, amazedly.
“This certainly is marvelously fast work!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no repetition of the signals.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a while Jack was content to gaze about
him in idle wonder. He seemed indifferent to
his plight. He drank in the scenes about him,
gazed interestedly at other air-craft that passed
them, and watched the sky begin to turn a dull
slate color. It was the dawn of another day of
carnage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Others, too, were on the watch for these faint
signs of day. From somewhere came the long,
awful boom of a huge cannon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack tried to get up, but fell back to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>268</a></span>
former position. He only then realized that he
was chained to his seat. He had a certain amount
of freedom, but beyond that he was a prisoner,
helpless.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” mused Jack upon this discovery, “even
if my hands and feet were free, I could not escape
from this height. We must land some time,
and then I’ll have more need to use them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Jack settled back to watch developments.
Now everything was astir. A faint murmur was
wafted to him on the morning breeze.</p>

<p class='c009'>He could see the soldiers moving about, the
great cannons and howitzers beginning to lumber
onward, the column of Uhlans already in
saddle, and the hundreds of air-craft rising to
greet the early sun’s rays.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s wonderful!” whispered Jack, fascinated.
“Yes, wonderful, but how terrible! This whole
array is primed to create nothing but havoc, sorrow,
destruction, and death! Gee, but I’m glad
the good old United States has no need for such
military organization!”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>269</a></span>
Another sound came to his ears, and cut short
his thoughts of America. In an astonishingly
brief time, the Army of the Invasion had completed
its formations and was on the march, the
rank and file, all deep-throated men, singing
<em>Das Fatherland</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good God!” gasped Jack. “They are going
to their death with a song on their lips!”</p>

<p class='c009'>From somewhere in front of these columns
came a roar of cannon. The air was filled with
shrill, piercing shrieks as tons upon tons of metal,
charged with fearful destructive powers, tried to
stem the human flood.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a few minutes the smoke and steam hid
the dreadful spectacle from Jack. He gazed intently
below him, anxious to see the victor of
this clash.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, it must not be forgotten that the
human waves of men were supported by great
artillery fire on their own side. Unaided entirely
these men would have been annihilated
miles before the fortresses.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>270</a></span>
The ranks were on the double run now. Their
bayonets glistened in the dull sunlight. On, on,
ever on, they went, keeping perfect stride, never
faltering.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack could not tear his eyes from the sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even while storming the redoubt, the ranks
held firm. Another sheet of flame checked them
for a moment. They tried to recover, and somehow
couldn’t. Again came that destructive, raking
fire. The lines faltered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack trembled from excitement. Was this
magnificent effort to fail? He was not thinking
of them as Germans. He was only aware of
brave, dauntless men trying to best steel and explosives.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again came a sheet of flame.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ranks actually seemed to fall back.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then once more, from the rear, rose the deep
notes of <em>Das Fatherland</em>. It stiffened the thinned
ranks. They rushed forward, the fierce cry of
victory mingling with the strains of their national
anthem.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_271' id='Page_271'>271</a></span>
“That was great!” cried Jack. “My sympathies
are not very strongly with the Germans,
but I’m bound to give credit where credit is due.
Well, what now——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack became aware that the machine on which
he was a prisoner was going to make a landing.
Silently, swiftly, the winged mechanism was
guided toward earth behind the German lines.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack smiled with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll have a chance to stretch my legs,” he
said. “As long as Radwig is dead, I have not so
much to fear. I wonder what they want of me?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_272' id='Page_272'>272</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXXVIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br /> <br />MILITARY CROSS-EXAMINATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The machine came to a stop. The pilot never
moved from his seat. Instead, he motioned to a
soldier to come to him. Evidently a few words
were exchanged.</p>

<p class='c009'>A sharp command was issued.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two soldiers came up to Jack. He held up
his hands to show that he was chained. One of
the soldiers leaned forward, and pressed a button
at the side of the car. The chains fell from
Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without comment the two soldiers seized Jack
and flanked him. A detail of six additional men
fell in step, a petty officer wheeled about,—a
movement that acted as a signal for the soldiers
to march.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>273</a></span>
A five-minute walk brought them to a small
cottage. Here they halted. Jack was blindfolded.
When the bandage was removed, he
found himself facing an elderly man seated at
a desk. Jack could not make out his features,
as they were hidden in a gray mask.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Sprechen sie Deutsch?</em>” he was asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack understood the question, and replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is your nationality?” came the question
in English.</p>

<p class='c009'>“American.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What part of America?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“New York.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your occupation?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wireless operator.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For your government?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, for the Transatlantic Shipping Combine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There followed a short pause. Jack was wondering
what next to expect. The questions had
been brief and propounded in a crisp,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_274' id='Page_274'>274</a></span>
commanding way. There was no leeway for equivocation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you tell the truth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do,” replied Jack quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do you tell the truth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I believe in it,” said Jack simply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under what circumstances did you first meet
Herr Radwig?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack, greatly surprised, hesitated. Would it
be wise to tell everything? How under the sun
did this man in the gray mask know so much?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remember, the truth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack thought quickly. The question implied
that this officer had some knowledge of his dealings
with Radwig. Possibly, also, the officer was
about to test the value of his declaration that he
told the truth. So Jack figured. But was this
not an amazing illustration of the wonderful
efficiency and thoroughness of the German Secret
Service.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Speak!” came the imperative command.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well,” replied Jack calmly. “It was on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_275' id='Page_275'>275</a></span>
the <em>Kronprinzessin Emilie</em>. It seemed that we
were about to be dashed to pieces on floating icebergs.
Some shrieked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘The <em>Titanic</em>!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘The boats!’ shouted a man. He violently
pushed two women aside, wedged in the panic-stricken
throng. I stood at the head of the companion
way. The man told me to get out of the
way. I tried to calm the people. But this man
seemed to have lost his reason. He rushed at
me, trying to strike me. I was too quick for him.
I struck first. He staggered back, subdued. It
was only later that I learned this man’s name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then—how and when did you meet Herr
Radwig?”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Jack had to relate incident after incident.
Always, at the end of a recital, came the same
question, asked in the same matter-of-fact tone
of voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then—when and where did you meet
Herr Radwig?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything must have its end. At last Jack
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_276' id='Page_276'>276</a></span>
had modestly related every episode with which
the reader has been made acquainted. The even
tone of his questioner, his piercing eyes, and the
unbroken silence was beginning to weary Jack.
He felt that he could hardly keep his wits about
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Evidently the German officer noticed these
signs and was patiently waiting for them. He
leaned forward, and the steady monotone now
gave place to a rasping, menacing gruffness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are you?” he suddenly snapped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An American,” came the tired reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An American!” jeered the officer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and I’m proud of it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why should you be proud of something you
could not help?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand you,” replied Jack, passing
his hand over his brow as if to clear away
the ever increasing drowsiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t understand me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Answer me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>277</a></span>
Jack opened his mouth to speak, his lips
moved, but he could utter no sound. He stood
still, staring stupidly at the man in front of him.
His thoughts were befuddled. What did he—the
man in the gray mask—want?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish those eyes wouldn’t glare at me so,”
Jack mumbled to himself. “I didn’t do anything
to them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the eyes behind the gray mask became
larger, rounder, more compelling. Jack knew
instinctively that they meant him harm. What
power they held! Something within him fought
to arouse him. He tried to move and could not.
Larger, ever larger those eyes seemed to grow!
The features of the man were lost; in fact, those
eyes seemed to belong to no one; they seemed
to have life and power, dreadful power, of their
own.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack shrieked with terror!</p>

<p class='c009'>Was he lost?</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Did it ever occur to you that nature plays
many pranks? From the many learned books
and men—and from daily events—we are lead
to assume that nature is grim, relentless. On the
whole, this assumption is true. But one of the
things that has made nature a harder problem
for man to solve is that there are the most unexpected
exceptions to the most carefully proved
rules. Sometimes these exceptions take place
with things and sometimes with persons.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nature had played a prank with Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he came to his senses he found de Garros
solicitously bending over him, his broken
English running riot in his native French.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s up?” questioned bewildered Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_279' id='Page_279'>279</a></span>
De Garros shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—er—<em>phew</em>! Zee—la—<em>compron</em>—eh—— I
understand not! You make zee big cry, I in
rush—excited much—<em>phew</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack sat up in bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are we still in Louvain?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>We</em>, <em>we</em>, certainly!” de Garros hastened to
assure him.</p>

<p class='c009'>A big sigh of relief welled from Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>“De Garros,” he said, “I have had the most
remarkable nightmare!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Whereupon Jack related to de Garros, as well
as he could recall the details, the dream that
had seemed so real.</p>

<p class='c009'>De Garros was thrilled. Every now and then
he broke into the recital with exclamations most
expressive of the impressions they made upon
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now,” Jack said in conclusion, “I think
it is best for us to dress. I have never dreamed
before, and I never want to dream again, if all
dreams are so terribly real.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_280' id='Page_280'>280</a></span>
De Garros laughingly agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Jack had dressed, he began to explore
the corridors of the hotel. He felt that Bill,
Tom Jukes and Pottle were guests of it. Of
course, the easiest way about it would have been
to inquire at the office.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the hour was rather early he did not care
to do this at once. A little later Jack was joined
by de Garros, and together they walked into the
dining room. Even at this hour several tables
were occupied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost at once the two were espied by their
friends. A more amazed and glad set of chaps
would have been indeed difficult to find anywhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Honest, Jack,” cried Bill, tears of real joy in
his eyes, “we had given up all hope of ever seeing
you again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Man alive!” declared Tom Jukes, “you can’t
imagine how we felt, for we knew that there was
no chance of getting through to save you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blues—here—everybody!” exploded Pottle.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_281' id='Page_281'>281</a></span>
“Funeral cheerful in comparison—no eat—no
food—just blues!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Jack,” invited Bill, “and de Garros,
breakfast with us and tell us about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So, between mouthfuls, Jack related his experiences
with Radwig’s party of Uhlans. Affectionately
he placed his hand on de Garros’
arm, and soberly said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I owe my life to you. If it hadn’t been for
you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was sure luck, the greatest ever,” declared
Tom Jukes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fine stuff—fooled the enemy—shot at sunrise—others
get shot instead—up in the air—down
again—all safe—at last—hurray!” cried
Pottle, capering about wildly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t think it was luck,” said Jack gravely.
“I think there was a higher power than that
concerned in it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are right,” agreed Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Read—ee—<em>mon ami</em>, you ’ave not forget zee
dream,” slyly remarked de Garros.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>282</a></span>
Jack turned scarlet. Somehow he felt that it
was not very manlike to have even bothered with
nightmares.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s this?” demanded Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, now,” coaxed Tom; “don’t hold
anything back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dreams?” questioned Pottle. “Dreams?
Great stuff—big inventors—and Columbus—dreamers!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Jack went over that adventure again.</p>

<p class='c009'>This time, however, he decided to tell it in the
way it actually happened. The result was that
when Jack led them up to the climax he held
even de Garros spellbound.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack ceased to speak and looked at his
friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you get away?” asked Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t,” was the smiling reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t!” came the perplexed chorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>De Garros was chuckling softly. He had to
admire Jack’s cleverness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Battle—prisoner—great fight—man in gray
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>283</a></span>
mask—disappear—eyes bigger and bigger—what’s
this—fairy tale?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Pottle,” replied Jack, “it was only a
dream.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment there was silence and then they
all broke into peals of laughter, laughter that
seemed so strange and out of place in these days
frought with war’s devastation.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they had the good sense to check their merriment,
especially as they saw the eyes of many
surprised men and women upon them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They soon left the dining room, and prepared
to leave Louvain. Late that afternoon arrangements
were completed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Regretful good-byes were said to plucky little
de Garros, whose demonstrative eyes were wet
as he clasped their hands in farewell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We may nevaire meet again,” he stammered,
“but I nevaire forget you all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor will we forget you!” cried Jack warmly.
“You—you, if it hadn’t been for you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Read—ee, <em>mon ami</em>, you ’ave forget what you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>284</a></span>
do for me long ago. A fair exchange. You
save <em>my</em> life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re fine,” exploded Pottle. “Legion of
Honor cross for you—long war—much dead—much
wounded—but you’ll live!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A prediction, strangely enough, that came
true.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='chXL' class='c007'>CHAPTER XL.<br /> <br />OLD GLORY AGAIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Before the fall of Louvain, Jack and his
friends were across the border in France. Ultimately
they were lucky enough to rejoin the
<em>St. Mark</em>—sent for the accommodation of refugees—at
Marseilles.</p>

<p class='c009'>A cable was despatched to America, telling
of Tom Juke’s safety.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pottle, the young photographer, cabled his
paper, asking for permission to remain in the
battle zone. This was granted.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the trio—Jack, Bill and Tom—said farewell
to Pottle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I get back—possible—the paper will
make—hurrah!—look me up—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We sure will, old top,” promised Tom.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>286</a></span>
The voyage across was without incident, save
that, as was expected, they were stopped by British
warships.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, one fine morning, unannounced, Jack
called upon Uncle Toby Ready. The old tar
gave vent to a great cry of joy. Though Jack
had often been away for long periods, Uncle
Toby never fully knew the thrilling adventure
Jack had participated in. Now there was no
hiding of the truth. The war was at hand. The
Germans were sweeping everything before them.
How had it fared with Jack? This uncertainty
had worried Uncle Toby. He felt that he would
never be able to forgive himself, had anything
happened to Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the first greetings were over, Uncle
Toby could not help but ask about his Golden
Embrocation and Universal Remedy for Man
and Beast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you meet up with the King of England?”
he queried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Uncle Toby,” laughed Jack, “I did not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>287</a></span>
“Be it so with the Kaiser?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not the Kaiser, either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How now—was it the Czar?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But made a—use of ’em?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied Jack with a twinkle in his eye.
“I did make——”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment there came a sharp rap on the
door. Jack opened it, and a messenger, upon
ascertaining who he was, handed him a telegram.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What now?” demanded Uncle Toby.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack tore open the envelope. The inclosed
sheet read:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Congratulations and grateful appreciation.
Report immediately.</p>

<div class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Jacob Jukes.</span>”</div>

<p class='c010'>“Yeou ain’t a-goin’ back to Europe!” declared
Uncle Toby emphatically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t worry, Uncle,” replied Jack. “I don’t
think it is for that Mr. Jukes wants me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if he don’t,” replied the old captain,
“give ’im a bottle of my Golden Embrocation
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_288' id='Page_288'>288</a></span>
and Universal Remedy for Man and Beast with
my compliments.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” laughed Jack as he put the bottle
in his pocket, never intending, of course, to carry
out the errand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack found Mr. Jukes in earnest conversation
with his son, Tom. However, the moment Jack
entered, father and son arose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jack,” said Mr. Jukes, extending his hand,
“let me thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was said sincerely and simply. Their handclasp
was hearty and true.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Jukes began to pace the office.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tom looked at Jack and winked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Young man,” suddenly said Mr. Jukes,
sternly addressing Jack, “you are bound to succeed
in life. You have the <em>makings</em>. You have
your trade—or shall I call it profession? But
operating wireless is not everything. You can
be a wireless operator all your life and your salary
will be your only means of keeping the wolf
from the door. Too many of our people have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_289' id='Page_289'>289</a></span>
to depend on that means of support. Some day
I feel it will be different. At all events, I shall
make a beginning with you. So Tom and I have
decided to give you a number of shares in our
Combine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thereupon Mr. Jukes went on to explain the
value of the shares, instructing Jack just what
he should do with them. To tell the truth, Jack
had never troubled himself very much with the
intricacies of stock values.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally Jack left Mr. Jukes’ office feeling like
a millionaire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Strange,” mused Jack, “that this good fortune
should come to me when thousands of others
are losing their all in Europe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Feeling thus satisfied, Jack decided to acquaint
Helen Dennis with the good news. As he
strolled down to the dock, he could not help but
note that in so far as New York was concerned,
the war did not exist. People went about their
business in their accustomed way. Beyond the
usual set or serious expression characteristic of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_290' id='Page_290'>290</a></span>
the average New Yorker when he is engaged in
earning his dividends or salary, as the case may
be in different instances and walks of life, the
average person seemed absolutely unconcerned
of the World Tragedy that was unfolding itself
across the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the docks, however, there was increased
activity. The demand upon American ammunition
and commodities had jumped by leaps
and bounds. Shippers were reaping a harvest.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <em>Silver Star</em>, Captain Dennis’ ship, was in
port. Jack had little difficulty in getting aboard.
Captain Dennis was delighted to see Jack. He
could spare but little time, so when Jack had
told him only briefly of his experiences, the wise
tar, his eyes twinkling with mischief, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, Jack, don’t you think Helen would
be more interested in your adventures?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack blushed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, lad,” laughed the captain, “we
all have those days, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Jack made his way to the captain’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_291' id='Page_291'>291</a></span>
But let us say nothing more of them; rather
let us ask what became of Bill Raynor?</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Just before Jack called upon his Uncle Toby,
Bill had expressed a desire to stroll about the
Great City.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see,” Bill said in explanation, “the sight
of old New York makes me glad to be back
again. They say it’s a selfish place. Well, perhaps
there are towns that make you feel more
at home, but once you know Manhattan’s ways,
you don’t want to change!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have it your way,” agreeably laughed Jack.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they parted for the time being.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feeling hungry, Bill decided to visit one of
the select downtown restaurants his purse seldom
allowed him to patronize. Now, as the
reader will remember, Bill had no need to worry
over funds—at any rate, not for the immediate
future.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>293</a></span>
Bill thoroughly enjoyed his meal. He left
the restaurant feeling like a prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those prices are steep,” he reflected, “but the
food and service are worth it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Barely had he walked a block when he recognized
Tom Jukes a few strides in front of him.
Bill’s first impulse was to hail Tom, but something
about the latter made him hesitate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something seems queer,” muttered Tom,
puzzled. He was undecided. Should he follow
the millionaire’s son?</p>

<p class='c009'>Tom Jukes seemed anxious to avoid being
seen. Every now and then he glanced about him
hurriedly. He kept close to the building line,
his cap pulled over his eyes. He turned into
one of those ancient alleys down in the financial
district of New York.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill Raynor came to a quick decision.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll follow him!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment later Bill was also in the moldy
alleyway. Tom swung south, then west, and
south again, and finally halted before a pair of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_294' id='Page_294'>294</a></span>
ornamental iron gates of the most antique and
peculiar design.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill, mystified that such places still existed in
the Great Metropolis, dogged Tom’s footsteps,
always careful to keep well out of sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>He saw Tom pass through these iron gates. A
moment later Bill had followed Tom through,
though now he had to be far more careful, for
every flagstone seemed to give up a hollow
bellow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tom walked up an iron staircase clinging to
a decaying bulk of a dirt-gray stone ramshackle
building. He climbed one flight and then disappeared
from view.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill, very carefully—every nerve alert—followed.
A moment later he stepped into a long,
dim, lofty corridor, walled with marble of a
greenish tint, and smelling faintly of dry-rot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Picking his steps with the greatest caution,
Bill felt his way forward. Somewhere in front
of him he saw the shadowy form of Tom.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill saw Tom pause before a door, which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>295</a></span>
opened very slowly. A faint light came from
within. A moment later Tom had disappeared
from view.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill crept forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should he open the door?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish Jack were here,” said Bill to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack, it was, who had won the approval of
Jacob Jukes, head of the great shipping combine,
and father of Tom, for his masterly handling of
many difficult situations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under the circumstances, Bill did not flinch
in his determination to learn <em>what was going on
behind that door</em>!</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill put his ear to the door—and at once heard
a faint <em>tick-tick</em>, as well as a muffled voice.
Slowly Bill felt the door for the knob and to his
surprise he found there was none!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Entrance by signal only!” instantly decided
Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>But how was he to get in without it?</p>

<p class='c009'>His eyes were now more accustomed to the
gloom. He looked about him, hoping to find a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_296' id='Page_296'>296</a></span>
window or some outlet that might lead to the
barred room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Farther down the corridor, to his right, he saw
a stairway—or what appeared to be a stairway.
He walked toward it, always bearing in mind to
be extremely careful.</p>

<p class='c009'>He climbed up one flight without mishap. On
this floor, the feeling of desertion and forlorn
desolation grew deeper. Bill could barely suppress
a shiver.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly a rat scampered across the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phew!” ejaculated Bill, “this is <em>some</em> place!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He noticed a thin ray of daylight a short distance
from him. Bill at once decided to discover
its origin. A moment later he saw that
the light flowed from the cracks of a door.</p>

<p class='c009'>A brief investigation proved the door to be
unlocked. As he quietly pulled the door open
he saw that the room was absolutely bare, and
that the light came from the mud-pasted windows
facing a brick wall not five feet from them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill tip-toed across the room, and raised one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_297' id='Page_297'>297</a></span>
of the windows. To his satisfaction he at once
noticed the drain pipe at arm’s length. A moment
later he had slid to the floor below.</p>

<p class='c009'>To his surprise he saw the window of that
mysterious room wide open. He could see only
part of it. There seemed many men listlessly
sitting about, though the majority kept unseeing
eyes on a blackboard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A blind tiger!” breathed Bill, amazed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill meant that it was a fake racing broker’s
place. In years gone by there were many such
dens of evil in New York, where congregated
the broken-hearted, the reckless, the unscrupulous,
all of whom tempted fate on this horse or
that. As a rule the proprietor controlled the
destinies of his victims, for he could “fake” any
information he desired as to what horse won or
lost. Happily these dens are now more scarce
than hen’s teeth. It was these dens, the graves
of dupes, that were called <em>blind tigers</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does Tom play the ponies?” wondered Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>He listened intently.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_298' id='Page_298'>298</a></span>
Somewhere a ticker droned, and a husky voice
announced:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gas a half—five eighths; Steel six—nine hundred
at a quarter—a thousand—five-hundred—a
quarter—an eighth—Erie—an eighth—Steam—an
eighth——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does this mean?” questioned Bill. “It
sounds like stock quotations. Can it be——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He decided to risk glancing into the
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>At some risk of losing his hold he balanced
himself in order to accomplish his wish.</p>

<p class='c009'>He saw a room, unclean and unwholesome.
The men seemed to be of the discarded of the
street, the diseased and maimed of the financial
district; here and there was a younger, smarter
type, the kind that makes the gangster, the pickpocket
and worse. He also saw Tom sitting
quietly yet alert. At his elbow was a young
man, somewhat older than Tom. On the wall
facing the window was a great blackboard, and
as the ticker spelled out its information, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_299' id='Page_299'>299</a></span>
slovenly dressed clerk gave it voice, a second
clerk chalked away without cessation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond this clerk’s announcements everything
was quiet. Bill felt himself slipping, so he
silently swung back to his former position. The
light of understanding was in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By Jove, it’s a bucket shop!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now a bucket shop is where people buy and
sell stock on less margin or in smaller quantity
than is accepted on the curb on Broad Street or
on the Stock Exchange. These establishments,
too, are fast disappearing, though as is always
possible in New York, an exception—as in all
directions of semi-organized crime—manages to
keep from the sharp talons of the law for a
longer period of time.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bucket shops were where messenger
boys and clerks gamboled with Dame Fortune.
Sooner or later they lost—lost not only every
cent to their names, but much of their self-respect
and honesty. It was also the place for
the men who had gone down to defeat in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_300' id='Page_300'>300</a></span>
great battle fought bitterly every minute of the
day in the great financial arena. These men
were unfit for everything else, so they turned to
the bucket shops as a drowning man grasps at a
straw. But we have digressed enough—though
this was really necessary—and let us continue
with the narrative.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill did not know what to make of it all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Surely Tom Jukes had little need to play for
stakes. His father was sufficiently wealthy and
knew the great money game, and its pitfalls, not
to have acquainted his son with them. The more
Bill thought, the more puzzled he became.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly he heard Tom shout:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You robber, you thief!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Git out,” bawled the voice, evidently that of
the proprietor, “or I’ll have you put out!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do, and I’ll have you in the hands of the
police within twenty-four hours!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will, will you?” came the snarling challenge,
followed by a general commotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s where I take a hand!” decided Bill,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_301' id='Page_301'>301</a></span>
and leaped into the room, now in fearful confusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop!” cried Bill, drawing his revolver,
which he had a special permit to carry at any
time he wished, “or I’ll fire!”</p>

<p class='c009'>His command was obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stand where you are!” Bill demanded, noting
a suspicious movement on the part of several
to escape.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bill, good old Bill!” exclaimed Tom, overjoyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it’s Bill,” was the reply. “Call up Headquarters
while I hold them in line.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s your tip, Fred,” said Tom, turning to
the young man Bill had noticed before. “On
the run now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man called Fred seemed to need
no further invitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tom now joined Bill. From one of the drawers
of the desk at which the proprietor had been
seated, Tom brought to light an ugly-looking
Colt.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_302' id='Page_302'>302</a></span>
“Let’s move ’em toward the rear!” suggested
Tom. “Some of ’em are showing signs of restlessness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right!” acquiesced Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, at the point of the revolvers, everyone in
the room was lined up against the rear wall. The
older men, who had seen better days, appeared
indifferent to it all. To them life meant very
little. Spirit, youth, ambition, success had long
passed them by. They still clung to the vain
hope of winning something out of sheer habit.
Stock gambling, like opium, oftentimes urges on
its victim until the sands of life slowly ebb away.
The younger no-accounts scowled darkly. But
what could they do? Those two lads were too
business-like to attempt anything rash.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say,” growled the proprietor, addressing
Tom, “can’t we call this quits?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing doing!” was the curt reply, both
boys at once becoming more alert that ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aw, take a joke,” pleaded the man. “I’ll
square it with you. Honest I will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_303' id='Page_303'>303</a></span>
Both boys remained silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell you what,” continued the owner,
“just to square myself, I’ll throw in one hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Five hundred!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re going out of business,” announced
Tom. “Save your breath!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One thousand dollars!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One more word,” warned Bill, “and I won’t
be responsible for my action. Keep still.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Defeated, the man depicted his silent disdain.</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment later Fred and the police arrived.
The police captain in charge wanted the boys to
go along to press the charge, but Tom, upon
quickly satisfying the officer of their intentions
of doing so the next day—especially establishing
that Tom was the son of Jacob Jukes, the multimillionaire—were
at liberty to proceed as they
pleased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Explanations are now in order.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Correct,” replied Tom. “Let me first
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_304' id='Page_304'>304</a></span>
introduce Fred Strong, an old-time friend of mine.
Bill Raynor, one of the finest boys in the world!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The introduction was acknowledged with appropriate
remarks. Tom then unfolded a most
interesting story. Fred was a Wall Street clerk—and,
like many others, dabbled in stocks. He
kept on losing. So, desperate, he attempted to
court luck at the bucket shop a friend of his had
told him of. For a time he won. His hopes
rose. Then the inevitable reverses began. The
proprietor meanwhile had studied his victim.
Fred, without realizing it, became one of his
dupes. He loaned money from every one. He
began to tamper with his books. Disgrace
stared him in the face when he met Tom. A
few hours had straightened out all tangles. Tom,
however, insisted on bringing the bucket shop
keeper to book.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that’s all to it!” interspersed Tom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold on,” expostulated Bill, “why did you
sneak along the street as if wishing to be unrecognized?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_305' id='Page_305'>305</a></span>
“Easy,” replied Tom. “Saw dad, across the
street, so had to—as you say—<em>sneak</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Phew!</em>” whistled Bill, astonished. “I never
saw him. One other point, how did you know
the revolver was in that desk?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems,” answered Tom, “that the bucket
shop proprietor made it a practice to show new
customers that weapon. I suppose it was an
effective reminder that all disagreements might
be settled rather abruptly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” chimed in Fred, “let us forget about
it. I’ll never play the market again. But, boys,
I want you to come with me. I have to tell this
story to the sweetest girl in town. You’ve got
to meet her!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you insist, lead on,” replied Tom. “But
suppose you tell her the truth of the matter, and
then,—well—I guess Bill and I will be honored,
I’m sure!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bill laughed outright.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never suspected,” he said, “you had so much
of the so-called ‘society sass’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_306' id='Page_306'>306</a></span>
Tom chuckled with glee. He was highly
satisfied with the first day’s adventure in America.
In excellent spirits, the trio rode uptown.
While en route Bill briefly told, in turn, of
catching sight of Tom, and the consequences
thereof.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour later Fred brought them to a neatly
nestled house. There was a hand-ball court on
the property, and Fred saw to it that they were
made to feel at home. Then he entered the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Elsie,” said Fred, when first greetings were
over and they were comfortably settled, “I’ve
something to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Fred?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I couldn’t buy you the engagement ring—be—because
I lost the money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is <em>too</em> bad! But don’t mind it, dear. I
can wait.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s nice of you to say it, but I lost the money
on stocks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me about it,” she requested calmly,
though there was a break in her voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_307' id='Page_307'>307</a></span>
So Fred related the facts already familiar to
us. Nor did he spare himself in the recital.
At its conclusion, there was a moment’s silence.
Then——</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fred,” said the girl softly, “I’m glad you
told me of this. Please, Fred, don’t gamble
again—whether it be on cards or stocks—and if
you were younger—I’d add buttons and marbles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve already promised not to do so—but Elsie,
I have something else to tell you. I have a new
position at a higher salary—thirty dollars a
week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s great!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’ll be more—if I make good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fred, I’m <em>so</em> glad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The cost of living is very high now,” asked
Fred—“isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should say so! Diamonds will soon be
cheaper than onions or potatoes or cut sugar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Elsie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_308' id='Page_308'>308</a></span>
“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you like—could you—I mean—er—do
you think two persons could live on thirty
dollars a week?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Certainly!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How about <em>us</em>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, George!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Elsie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A blissful interval. Then—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Elsie—I’ve completely forgotten! Those
two boys I told you of are playing handball.
They insisted that I confess my crimes before
you met them!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment later Fred was introducing Tom
and Bill to Elsie. The young lady’s form of
greeting was most unexpected and unconventional.
Before either of the boys could surmise
her intention, she had kissed them!</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course general laughter and banter followed.
Of this let us say no more.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reader, however, may rest assured that
the boys whose adventures we have followed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_309' id='Page_309'>309</a></span>
through six volumes were always true to American
ideals and aspirations. They participated
in many strange and thrilling adventures. We
may write of these in the near future, but for
the time being, with every good wish for the
bright future that appears assured to them, we
will bid farewell to the Ocean Wireless Boys.</p>
